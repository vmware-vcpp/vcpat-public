VMware perpetual licenses, including OEM versions, can only be utilized to support internal IT operations that are not part of service delivery. In addition, VMware perpetual licenses may not be used to support the management or operations of an environment utilized to host unaffiliated third parties. Virtual machines running on hosts with perpetual or demo license keys are metered by Usage Meter.\nConfiguration #  The Usage Meter administrator must configure the endpoint and credentials for each vCenter server to be metered using the Usage Meter web application.\nFeature Detection #  When metering vCenter, Usage Meter performs two types of usage collections: event-based and inventory collections.\nEvent history collections #  Usage meter subscribes to vCenter events to detect changes in a virtual machine and host state. Changes in a virtual machine state are delivered every hour to Usage Meter and recorded.\nNote: Usage Meter collects data from hosts and VMs in an active state. Even when there is a connectivity issue with a host, Usage Meter will still report metering data if the host VMs are in a powered-on state. This means that providers will be billed for VMs even when there are temporary interruptions in host connectivity. If providers want to be sure they are not being billed for VMs, they need to turn those VMs off.\nInventory collections #  Usage Meter queries vCenter servers every eight hours to collect full inventory information.\nvCenter Reporting #  The vCenter Server Standard edition is part of the Flex Core bundle and therefore reported as part of that bundle. vCenter usage is bundled by default and cannot be reported standalone.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/docs/developer-ready-cloud/operations/","title":"Operations","section":"Developer Ready Cloud","content":"Operations #  API Tokens in Cloud Director #  VMware Cloud Director 10.3.1 introduced API Tokens. This allows a user to generate API tokens for programmatic access to VCD. It works for both, provider, and tenant users. An automation script or 3rd-party solution can then use the API token to make API requests to Cloud Director on behalf of the user.\nThese steps are used to create API tokens:\n The provider propagates the right to use and manage API token to the tenant The Cloud Director user (provider as well as tenant user) creates an API token An API client (e.g. an automation script) uses the API token to make requests (If needed) The user revokes the API token  Preparation #  As for most new features, fine-grained access control through rights bundles is possible. To enable a tenant to use API token, the provider must publish a rights bundle to the tenant. Privileges can be defined for a user to manage the user’s own tokens, and to manage all Organization user’s token (for example for an Organization Administrator).\nCreate the API Token #  As provider or tenant user with proper privileges you can use the “User Preferences” menu to create the API token. Each token can be labeled with a name. Be aware that the actual token key is only visible once in the creation wizard and cannot be retrieved afterwards.\nRevoke the API Token #  API tokens do not expire, but existing API tokens can be revoked. This also invalidates active API client sessions that used the token to authenticate. All users can revoke their own tokens. Administrators (those with \u0026lsquo;manage all user\u0026rsquo;s API tokens\u0026rsquo; right) can revoke other user\u0026rsquo;s tokens. Tenant administrators can do so within their own Organization, while system administrators can do so for any user.\nUse the API Token #  Semantically the API token usage follows the OAuth 2.0 specification (RFC 6749, section 6).\nThe API token can then be used by a 3rd-party solution or custom API client to access the VCD API as the user, without the need to authenticate with username and password credentials.\nAPI Client Example #  Request the bearer token for subsequent calls using the API token:\nPOST https://host_name/oauth/provider/token Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Body: grant\\_type=refresh\\_token\u0026amp;refresh\\_token=Generated\\_API_Token  Security note: It’s recommended to send the API Token as part of the request body (and not as part of the URL, even if that technically works for x-www-form-urlencoded type requests), to avoid it being logged in transit.\nResponse containing the Bearer token:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json Body: { \u0026quot;access\\_token\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Generated\\_Access_Token\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;token_type\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Bearer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;expires_in\u0026quot;:86400, \u0026quot;refresh_token\u0026quot;:null }  Subsequent API call now can use the returned Bearer token in the \u0026ldquo;access_token\u0026rdquo; field as usual. There is no need for any changes in the client code.\nSubsequent Call using the Bearer token:\nGET https://host_name/api/org Accept: application/*+xml;version=36.1 Authorization: Bearer Generated\\_Access\\_Token  Notes #  The session expiration can be configured in the provider portal under General \u0026gt; Timeouts.\nThe VCD Provider for Terraform for example supports API Token authentication as of version 3.5:\nprovider \u0026quot;vcd\u0026quot; { user = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot; password = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot; auth\\_type = \u0026quot;api\\_token\u0026quot; api_token = Generated API token sysorg = \u0026quot;System\u0026quot; ...  For security reasons, certain tasks are not possible when authenticated through an API token:\n Change the user password Perform user management tasks Create more tokens View or revoke other tokens  When accessing VMware Cloud Director by using an API access token, applications have only view rights for the following resources.\n User Group Roles Global roles Rights bundles  The API Token feature in VMware Cloud Director offers a secure way for automation solutions to access its API, even in environments that enforce Multi-factor Authentication for user logins.\nReference links: #  VCD Tenant Portal Documentation: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Tenant-Portal-Guide/GUID-A1B3B2FA-7B2C-4EE1-9D1B-188BE703EEDE.html\nVCD Provider Portal Documentation: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-A1B3B2FA-7B2C-4EE1-9D1B-188BE703EEDE.html\nOAuth 2.0 Specification (RFC 6749): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6\nVCD Provider for Terraform 3.5.1 Documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/networking-security/operations/","title":"Operations","section":"Networking \u0026 Security","content":"Operations #  Your content comes here!\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/sovereign-cloud/operations/","title":"Operations","section":"Sovereign Cloud","content":"Operations #  Your content comes here!\n"}]
