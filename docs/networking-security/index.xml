From VMware Cloud Director 10.2 and onwards, VMware Cloud Director provides load balancing services in NSX-T backed organization virtual data centers (VDCs) by leveraging the capabilities of VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi).</description></item><item><title>Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</guid><description>(this page is here as a placeholder)
Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Certificate Management</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/cert-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/cert-management/</guid><description>Networking and Security Certificate Management #</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</guid><description>Networking and Security Design # The {VVS for CP Title} validated solution has objectives to deliver prescriptive content about the solution so that it is fast to deploy and is suitable for use in production environments.

Carefully review the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook before implementation to avoid costly rework and delays.</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Shutdown and Startup</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/shutdown-startup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/shutdown-startup/</guid><description>Networking and Security Shutdown and Startup #</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Verification</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/verification/</guid><description>Networking and Security Verification #</description></item><item><title>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</guid><description>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director # Introduction # Before you start implementing the Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director solution, you must set up an environment that has a specific compute, storage, and network configuration and that provides external services to the components of the solution.
