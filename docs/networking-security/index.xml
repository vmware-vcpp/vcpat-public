Use the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook to capture environment specific input values that are required during the implementation.
Carefully review the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook before implementation to avoid costly rework and delays.</description></item><item><title>Networking &amp; Security Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</guid><description>Networking &amp;amp; Security Design # Coming soon!</description></item><item><title>Networking &amp; Security Implementation</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/implementation/</guid><description>Networking &amp;amp; Security Implementation # Configuring VMware Cloud Director service for Load Balancing as a Service # See the instructions below on how to deploy and configure VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer in combination with VMware Cloud Director to provide Load Balancing as a Service capabitilies for end users.

From VMware Cloud Director 10.2 and onwards, VMware Cloud Director provides load balancing services in NSX-T backed organization virtual data centers (VDCs) by leveraging the capabilities of VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi).</description></item><item><title>Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</guid><description>(this page is here as a placeholder)
Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</guid><description>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director # Introduction # Before you start implementing the Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director solution, you must set up an environment that has a specific compute, storage, and network configuration and that provides external services to the components of the solution.
Requirements # Software # To implement load balancing as a service with VMware Cloud Director, your software versions must meet the requirements specified in the VMware Product Interoperability Matrix.</description></item></channel></rss>
