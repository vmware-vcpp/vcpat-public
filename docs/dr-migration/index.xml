Each of them comes with their unique self-signed SSL certificate during the deployment. But still, these certificates need to be replaced when they expire, or if the providers prefer to use CA-signed ones to make sure there will be no browser warnings, for example.</description></item><item><title>DR and Migration Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/design/</guid><description>DR and Migration Design # The {VVS for CP Title} validated solution has objectives to deliver prescriptive content about the solution so that it is fast to deploy and is suitable for use in production environments.

You can directly reuse the PowerShell commands by replacing the provided sample values with values from your VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook.

Use the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook to capture environment specific input values that are required during the implementation.
Carefully review the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook before implementation to avoid costly rework and delays.</description></item><item><title>DR and Migration Shutdown and Startup</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/shutdown-startup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/shutdown-startup/</guid><description>DR and Migration Shutdown and Startup #</description></item><item><title>DR and Migration Verification</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/verification/</guid><description>DR and Migration Verification #</description></item><item><title>Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/setup-vcda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/setup-vcda/</guid><description>Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability # Port mapping # The communication between the different appliances occurs at the following ports as shown on the diagram.

Have a properly deployed Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC). Have a VMware Cloud Director deployed at VMC on AWS (Cloud Director service) that is linked to the SDDC.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Director Availability Certificate Management</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/vcda-gcve-sddc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/vcda-gcve-sddc/</guid><description>Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability at a GCVE SDDC # User Permissions for Google Cloud VMware Engine # The default vSphere administrative user that comes with Google Cloud VMware Engine is CloudOwner@gve.local. Despite its administrative rights, the CloudOwner user misses some privileges (like Host.Config.Connection, for example) for the VMware Cloud Director Availability Classic data engine to operate properly. Even the temporary elevation of the CloudOwner privileges (link) does not help to perform a successful replication.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Director Availability Multi-NIC Configuration</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/multi-nic-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/multi-nic-config/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Director Availability Multi-NIC Configuration # Overview # Placing the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances in different networks is something common for Service Providers. This leads to the need to use multiple network interfaces to support that scenario and guarantee the product will continue operating as per design.
There are a few main reasons that lead to this design:
Bypass a router
Port forwarding is not possible</description></item></channel></rss>
