As a result, there is only one local user for each appliance - the system administrator user (root).
VMware Cloud Director Availability uses the root user account for access to both the virtual appliance console and the management interface. The initial deployment of each VMware Cloud Director Availability appliance sets up this account.</description></item><item><title>DR and Migration Personas</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/personas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/personas/</guid><description>DR and Migration Personas # In the VMware Cloud Director Availability terminology, there are two types of personas:
Service providers manage VMware Cloud Director Availability objects and the local VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances after authenticating as VMware Cloud Director System Administrator users.

There are a few main reasons that lead to this design:
Bypass a router
Port forwarding is not possible</description></item></channel></rss>
