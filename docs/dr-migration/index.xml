Use the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook to capture environment specific input values that are required during the implementation.
Carefully review the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook before implementation to avoid costly rework and delays.</description></item><item><title>DR &amp; Migration Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/design/</guid><description>DR &amp;amp; Migration Design # Architecture # The following diagram shows the network flow between the VMware Cloud Director Availability components and the other infrastructure components part of the replication process.
Other Components # Platform Services Controller # All the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances need to be configured with a Lookup Service for two purposes:
Service authentication and resource discovery â€“ the Replicator and Management appliances require registration with a Lookup Service to authenticate to the resource vCenters and discover resources which is required for operations from the VMware Cloud Director Availability workflow.</description></item><item><title>DR &amp; Migration Implementation</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/implementation/</guid><description>DR &amp;amp; Migration Implementation # Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability at VCD cloud # You can find all the configuration steps needed in the Setting up VMware Cloud Director Availability document.

Have a properly deployed Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC). Have a VMware Cloud Director deployed at VMC on AWS (Cloud Director service) that is linked to the SDDC.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Director Availability Certificate Management</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/certificate-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/certificate-management/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Director Availability Certificate Management # The SSL certificates are essential for establishing a trusted connection between the different VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances and their proper service.
Each of them comes with their unique self-signed SSL certificate during the deployment. But still, these certificates need to be replaced when they expire, or if the providers prefer to use CA-signed ones to make sure there will be no browser warnings, for example.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Director Availability Certificate Management</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/vcda-gcve-sddc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/vcda-gcve-sddc/</guid><description>Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability at a GCVE SDDC # User Permissions for Google Cloud VMware Engine # The default vSphere administrative user that comes with Google Cloud VMware Engine is CloudOwner@gve.local. Despite its administrative rights, the CloudOwner user misses some privileges (like Host.Config.Connection, for example) for the VMware Cloud Director Availability Classic data engine to operate properly. Even the temporary elevation of the CloudOwner privileges (link) does not help to perform a successful replication.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Director Availability Multi-NIC Configuration</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/multi-nic-config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/dr-migration/multi-nic-config/</guid><description>VMware Cloud Director Availability Multi-NIC Configuration # Overview # Placing the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances in different networks is something common for Service Providers. This leads to the need to use multiple network interfaces to support that scenario and guarantee the product will continue operating as per design.
There are a few main reasons that lead to this design:
Bypass a router
Port forwarding is not possible</description></item></channel></rss>
