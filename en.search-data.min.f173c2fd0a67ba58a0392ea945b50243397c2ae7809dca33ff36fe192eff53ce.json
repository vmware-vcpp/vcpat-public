Here you can find suggestions on how to plan, set up and operate your DR and Migration services.\nVMware Cloud Director Availability #  VMware Cloud Director Availability is a Disaster-Recovery-as-a-Service solution. It is specially designed and available for participants in VMware Cloud Provider Program and allows them to protect and migrate vApps and VMs:\n From on-premises vCenter Server site to a VMware Cloud Director cloud From VMware Cloud Director cloud to an on-premises vCenter Server environment Between VMware Cloud Director managed clouds  Use Cases #  VMware Cloud Director Availability supports two different use cases – disaster recovery and migration of vApps/VMs. Both of them rely on replication of virtual machines. In both cases at least one of the sides is a VMware Cloud Director managed cloud and the other side could be another VMware Cloud Director cloud or vCenter on-premises site. VMware Cloud Director Availability cannot protect or migrate bare metal servers or VMs managed by non-VMware hypervisors.\nDisaster Recovery #  A tenant can purchase DRaaS provided by a public cloud and based on VMware Cloud Director Availability to protect their virtual machines running in their on-premises datacenter. The Cloud Provider assigns a portion of compute, storage, and network resources from their cloud and groups them in an Organization Virtual Data Center (OrgVDC) that belongs to the tenant. Also, the Cloud Provider can enable this OrgVDC (respectively, the tenant) to protect their on-premises virtual workloads to the cloud with specific parameters like minimum RPO, bandwidth control, direction of the protection, and more. It allows the tenant to failover their VMs in case of an outage in their on-premises data center.\nMigration #  When tenants plan to migrate workloads to the cloud, they may use the Migration workflow to simplify the process. When a “New Migration” is configured, VMware Cloud Director Availability starts replication of the vApp/VM from the source to the destination.\nAppliances #  There are three VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances required for the setup in the cloud and one on-premises appliance to be deployed at the tenant\u0026rsquo;s on-premises site.\nCloud Replication Management Appliance #  The Cloud Replication Management appliance is responsible for the communication with VMware Cloud Director. Based on this communication, it discovers resources (OrgVCD, storage policies, datastores, networks, etc.) managed by VMware Cloud Director and used by the tenants. This information is required for discovering vApps/VMs that can be replicated/migrated or suitable destination locations for incoming replications/migrations.\nIt also provides the VMware Cloud Director Availability UI and API interfaces. Another role of this appliance is to communicate with all the local and remote Replicators and receive data regarding each protected/migrated workload. Two VMware Cloud Director Availability services cover these functionalities in Cloud Replication Management appliance – the cloud.service and the manager.service.\nCloud Service #  This service understands the VMware Cloud Director constructs – OrgVCD, vApps, networks managed by VMware Cloud Director, storage policies, etc. To achieve this VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Management appliance communicates with the VMware Cloud Director API through the VMware Cloud Director LB. The Cloud Replication Management appliance does not communicate with the VMware Cloud Director consoleproxy cells/interfaces. Based on this, VMware Cloud Director Availability can:\n discover VMware Cloud Director managed vApps/VMs and protect/migrate them to another DR-enabled cloud or on-premises vCenter discover a suitable destination for incoming replications/migrations  The cloud service manages pairings with other DR-enabled clouds, policies, SLA profiles, and their assignment to VMware Cloud Director organizations. It provides information about the replication and system tasks. Also, it reports the replication compute resources consumption per tenant and per PVDC, the storage consumption per datastore, plus many other high- and low-level details. The cloud service management interface is available on https://vcda_manager_fqdn:443/admin. It is possible to log in with the local OS root account, an SSO account if the appliance has registration in an SSO domain, or with a VMware Cloud Director System Administrator account if the initial configuration is already completed.\nManager Service #  The manager service manages the registrations of local and remote replicators. During the pairing process, remote replicators are registered in the Cloud Replication Management appliance. For each replication, it chooses one replicator from the source site and one from the destination site. The destination replicator is responsible for discovering the appropriate resources to create the replica disks at the destination and write data. Replicators send information to the Cloud Replication Management appliance about their operation – statuses, amount of data replicated, operation start time, time to complete, etc. The manager service is also used to manage replicators. It can trigger the rebalancing of replications across all replicators or put a replicator in maintenance mode, which leads to assigning each of its replications to another one. This is useful when the current replicators need to be offloaded by adding a new replicator in the solution.\nThe manager service management interface is available at https://vcda_manager_fqdn:8441. It is possible to log in with the local OS root account and an SSO account if the appliance is already registered in Lookup Service.\nCloud Replicator #  Cloud Replicator is responsible for moving the replication data around - to and from the ESXi hosts and the cloud. For outgoing replications/migrations, it communicates with the VMKernel interface of the ESXi host, captures and encrypts replication data, optionally compresses it, and sends it to the remote replicator, which can be another Cloud Replicator or on-premises Replicator. For incoming replications/migrations the Cloud Replicator receives replication data from a Replicator (cloud or on-premises), decompresses and decrypts this data, and sends it to the ESXi to be written on a datastore. Cloud Replicator is the only component that can scale out as the number of protections/migrations increases.\nCloud Tunnel #  The Cloud Tunnel appliance is the single-entry point to the VMware Cloud Director Availability instance in the cloud. Its role is to handle and forward the incoming management and replication traffic. It is the only VMware Cloud Director Availability appliance that needs a dedicated Internet-accessible endpoint.\nOn-premises Appliance #  The VMware Cloud Director Availability on-premises appliance is deployed in the tenant data center. It creates a pairing relation to VMware Cloud Director Availability in the cloud and can protect and/or migrate VMs running locally. The on-premises appliance does not require a public endpoint as it only initiates connectivity to the cloud. A single on-premises appliance can protect VMs from a single SSO domain even if there are multiple vCenter Servers in this SSO domain. If the requirement is to do replications from the cloud to on-premises, then a single appliance is required for each vCenter due to how placement works. Also, one on-premises appliance can be paired to a single VMware Cloud Director Availability instance in the cloud. If the tenant intends to use more than one DR service in the cloud, a dedicated appliance is required for each cloud DR service.\nReference #  Official documentation\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/networking-security/","title":"Networking and Security","section":"Docs","content":"About Networking and Security #  The Networking and Security validated solution provides detailed design, implementation, configuration, and operation guidance on \u0026hellip; A VMware validated solution is a technical validated implementation that is built and tested by VMware and VMware cloud providers to help customers resolve common business use cases.

VMware recommends the use of appliances instead of Linux cells.\nNo need for Linux licensing as the case in vCloud Director on Linux. No need for external database, as VCD appliances come with internal Postgres database. VCD appliances requirements must be considered when designing the primary pod and the associated management cluster.   VCPLCM-VCD-002 Deploy VMware Cloud Director as a cluster of five nodes in the default management vSphere cluster. VCD appliances host embedded Postgres database. Clustering these instances using five nodes, one primary + two stand-by + two application cells.\n5 cells would allow for hosting up to 10,000 VMs and 400 tenants. More resources are required in the management cluster associated with the primary pod.   VCPLCM-VCD-003 Protect the VMware Cloud Director cluster virtual machines by using vSphere High Availability. Supports the availability objectives for VMware Cloud Director without requiring manual intervention during an ESXi host failure event. None.   VCPLCM-VCD-004 Apply vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler anti-affinity rules for the VMware Cloud Director cluster virtual machines. vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler prevents the VMware Cloud Director cluster virtual machines from residing on the same ESXi host and risking the high availability of the deployment. You must perform an additional configuration to set up an anti-affinity rule.\nFor a default management vSphere cluster that consists of four ESXi hosts, you can put in maintenance mode only a single ESXi host at a time.   VCPLCM-VCD-005 Place the VMware Cloud Director cluster virtual machines in a designated virtual machine folder. Provides the organization of the VMware Cloud Director cluster virtual machines in the management domain vSphere inventory. You must create the virtual machine folder during or after the deployment.   VCPLCM-VCD-006 Use embedded Postgres database for VCD. The virtual appliance includes an embedded PostgreSQL database fully managed by VMware Cloud Director with built-in replication for maintaining consistency between cells. External database nodes can increase licensing costs and management overhead. Using embedded database will require a dedicated network for Postgres database replication. This affects management cluster networking design.   VCPLCM-VCD-007 A single NFS Mount Point will be used for each VCD cells group. The VMware Cloud Director appliance supports only NFS type of shared storage.\nThe appliance deployment process involves mounting the NFS shared transfer server storage.\nVCD cells requires this shared storage to store VCD cells group configuration files. VCD appliances can’t start if this storage is not available. This NFS share is also used as a temporary storage for uploads, downloads, and cloning operations across different VMware vCenter instances. Once the transfer operation is completed the data is deleted from the transfer storage.\nVMware Cloud Director stores the appliance database backups in the pgdb-backup directory in the transfer share. These backup bundles might consume significant space.\nThe multi-cell log bundle collector occupies this space.\nThe multi-cell log bundle collector occupies this space. NFS share is required to be available to be able to deploy VCD cells.   VCPLCM-VCD-008 Use vSAN File Services for the NFS share of VCD cells rather than external NFS share on Linux/Windows Virtual Machine Use NFS File Service Functionality.\nStarting with vSAN 7.0, you can use the vSAN File Service functionality to export NFS shares by using NFS 3.0 and NFS 4.1 protocols.\nIt’s easier to configure and manage. It has its limitations as that of NFS File share and supports SMB, NFSv3 and NFSv4.1 file shares.    \nDesign Decisions for deploying VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager #     Design ID Design Decision Design Justification Design Implication     VCPLCM-001 Deploy the latest version of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager, i.e., 1.3 VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager 1.3 provides GUI feature, in addition to API and CLI and supports the latest products for deployment \u0026amp; management. N/A   VCPLCM-002 Deploy the latest VMware Provider Lifecycle Manager interop bundle. Interop Bundle contains definitions for new product interoperability and is made available whenever a new version of the supported product is released. Need to check for the latest interop bundle and download it manually in VMwaer Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager host.   VCPLCM-003 In VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager, you can use various methods to deploy or manage products like CLI, API and GUI. In this design document, The API method is suggested. Use API to deploy VMware Cloud Director. API is a simplified method for the product deployment. Either an existing JSON containing the environment details can be used or can manually deploy the products. The data center feature automates the configuration of underline deployment infrastructure every time a product is deployed.\nOnce can refer the sample postman collection for the deployment of VMware Cloud Director\n Need to have a knowledge of API and understanding of JSON structure.   VCPLCM-004 Use vSAN FS rather than external NFS share on Linux/Windows Virtual Machine Configure the VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager repository on an NFS server configured externally as it reduces the risk of consuming space on the VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager server when more products get deployed and subsequent binaries are copied.

It is a pervasive cloud infrastructure control plane for cloud providers’ service-delivery needs, and the management entity for a global VMware cloud estate. VMware Cloud Director allows seamless provisioning and consumption of cloud computing resources and services to geographically distributed lines of business and IT teams in an API-driven approach\nVMware vCloud Usage Meter\nVMware vCloud Usage Meter is a virtual appliance that collects usage data VMware products that are added for metering. The collected data is sent to vCloud Usage Insight, which aggregates the data and sends it to the VMware Commerce Portal. In that portal, the aggregated usage data automatically populates each month the partner\u0026rsquo;s MBO if automatic reporting is selected.\nVMware vRealize Tenant App for VMware Cloud Director\nVMware vRealize Tenant App for VMware Cloud Director is used for metering the infrastructure services provided by a service provider to their tenants. Further, it provides options to configure different models for pricing the metered infrastructure.\nRabbitMQ\nRabbitMQ is an open source distributed message broker. It facilitates the efficient delivery of messages in complex routing scenarios. Initially built around the popular AMQP protocol, it’s also highly compatible with existing technologies, while its capabilities can be expanded through plug-ins enabled on the server. RabbitMQ brokers can be distributed and configured to be reliable in case of network or server failure.\nCloud Infrastructure Architecture for VMware Cloud Foundation #  Description comment\nVMware VMware Cloud Director\nVCD diagram here\nVMware vCloud Usage Meter\nUM diagram here\nVMware vRealize Tenant App for VMware Cloud Director\nTenant App diagram here\nRabbitMQ\nRabbitMQ diagram here\n\nLogical Design For Product Deployment Using VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager #  The logical design provides a high-level overview of the solution design.\nDeployment Architecture\nTwo different deployment architectures are envisioned to be supported by VVS for Cloud Providers namely Standard and Consolidated. For the standard architecture, two workload domains are considered for the VCPP deployment: VI workload domain and Private Cloud Workload Domain\nThe SDDC management components and workload domains will be managed by the SDDC manager.\nStandard Architecture\nThis design is based on Standard Architecture where differemt Management and Workload Domains are used to segregate resources.\nVI Workload Domain\nThis deployment is based on the standard VCF deployment, consisting of a management domain and at least one workload domain.\nAll infrastructure and cloud management components are deployed in the management domain, being physically and logically isolated from the tenant workload. Workload domains (Compute (vCenter), storage (vSAN) and network (NSX-T)) are deployed on separate hosts and configured as provider VDCs in vCloud Director.\nAll vCenters are running in enhanced link mode.\nPrivate Cloud Workload Domain\nThis is required to support VCD\u0026rsquo;s CPOM (Central Point of Management) feature to allow direct access to dedicated vCenters. The vCenter provisioned for this domain must not have ELM enabled, as otherwise, users accessing the dedicated vCenter would be able to automatically have access to other vCenters as well.\nIn this architecture, each customer will get a dedicated workload domain (aka vSphere Cluster), managed by a single instance of VMware Cloud Director. The customer will consume infrastructure as a Cloud Director tenant without having vCenter server access due to ELM architecture in VCF 4.4.x release.\nConsolidated Architecture\nThis deployment is intended for smaller environments, requiring a minimum of 4 hosts for the complete deployment. Both management and customer workloads are deployed in a single vCenter (cluster) \u0026amp; resources are provided using vCenter server resource pools.\nVCPP Components in VMware Cloud Foundation.\nFor this design document, the following VCPP components must be deployed in the management domain of VMware Cloud Foundation.\nCore Components:\n  VMware Cloud Director cells (VCD)\n  NFS Share for VMware Cloud Director\n  VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager\n  External NFS share for VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager\n  Optional products that can be deployed using VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager\n  Usage Meter (UM)\n  RabbitMQ\n  vRealize Operations Manager Tenant App\n  Most of the components will be deployed in the management domain except for tenant \u0026amp; development workloads.\nThe following diagram shows the standard architecture with VI and private cloud workload domains (consolidated architecture cannot be combined with standard architecture).\nVMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager Architecture #  VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager is designed as an application that provides a REST API and GUI to perform the required tasks. The underlying implementation to integrate with the corresponding products VMware Cloud Director, vRealize\nOperations Manager Tenant App, RabbitMQ and Usage Meter are designed as generic product tasks.\nTo deploy or manage a solution, VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager requires a definition of the necessary tasks (deployment + validation, configuration, upgrade tasks) and product binaries (e.g., OVA). The REST API generic structure is applicable to different types of solutions.\nVMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager needs access to a repository (mounted NFS or locally) which contains OVA files, upgrade packages, etc.\nThe Below diagram represents the high-level architecture of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager\nWorkflow Execution Process Of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager #  Once a request is triggered by VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager’s REST API or GUI, then it will execute the corresponding task defining a list of actions. The task will be executed asynchronously. Each task will be associated with an ID which can be used to query the state of the task.\nDatacenter\nTo enable VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager to manage products, first you must register a data center component. The data center components are instances or services available in the data center that VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager does not manage. You can register vCenter Server, NSX-T, and vRealize Operations Manager as data center components.\nEnvironment\nProducts are deployed as a part of Lifecycle Manager environment. Each environment can have multiple products and user needs to provide a unique Environment ID during deployment, for identification purpose. VMware Cloud Provider doesn’t allow environments with duplicate Environment ID as it is referenced during retrieval, deletion of environment and product management operations like upgrades, node management, etc.\nTo deploy a product, the target vCenter to deploy in, has to be specified. This should refer to a vCenter that is registered as a datacenter component.\nProduct\nThe products follow a generic definition pattern that defines basic common product fields and requires product-specific details to be specified as properties.

But still, these certificates need to be replaced when they expire, or if the providers prefer to use CA-signed ones to make sure there will be no browser warnings, for example. This post will review the necessary steps to replace the Cloud Service, Manager Service, Replicator Service, and the Tunnel Service certificates with CA-signed ones. Prerequisites for the CA-signed certificate #    PKCS#12 (.pfx) certificate and the private key should use the same password\n  PKCS#12 file should contain only one entry - the private key and its corresponding certificate and, optionally, the certificate trust chain\n  RSA key size should be 2048-bit or larger\n  The certificate should not use insecure hash algorithms like SHA1 or MD5\n  Useful commands #  Command 1: Generate a new private key and Certificate Signing Request:\n openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key\nCommand 2: Convert .crt to .pem\n openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem\nCommand 3: Prepare a PKCS#12 (.pfx) from a .pem (in case your CA didn\u0026rsquo;t provide it to you)\n openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt\nUsual scenario #  It is sufficient for most providers to use a CA-signed certificate for the Cloud Service only and self-signed certificates for all other services. This CA-signed certificate has to be generated for the public address of VMware Cloud Director Availability. Steps #    Login through SSH with the root user to the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service host.\n   Generate a new private key and Certificate Signing Request using the following command:\n   openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key\nFill in the necessary data similar to this example   Once the CSR is generated, you need to transfer it to the CA for signing.\n  If the received CA-signed certificate is not in PKCS#12 format (.pfx), please use the following command to prepare it:\n   openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privateKey.key -in certificate.crt -certfile CACert.crt\n(where privateKey.key is the private key used for the CSR and CACert.crt is the CA certificate)\n Load the certificate to the Cloud Service using:\n  VMware Cloud Director Availability UI:     Navigate to the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service URL (https://Appliance-IP-Address/ui/admin.)    Log in as root.    Select Settings from the left pane called Configuration.      Under Appliance Settings, you will find Certificate.      Click Import.    Fill in the Export Password (specified while creating the .pfx).      Click Apply.     VMware Cloud Director Availability API through command-line:     Transfer the .pfx file to the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service host.    Log in as root through SSH to the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service host.    Log in as root to the VMware Cloud Director Availability API through the command-line using:    c4 loginroot 'password'\n    Upload the new certificate using:    c4 upload_certificate /path/to/cert/cert.pfx 'Export password'\n     The VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service will be restarted after the certificate change.\n  You will no longer see any warnings in the browser.\n  Affected services #  To see what other services are affected by the change and fix, you can open System Health under Monitoring in the left pane.\nYou can see that the connectivity to the Tunnel Service is showing failure.\nTo fix it, you need to perform the steps in Procedure 1.\nProcedure 1: #    Click on Settings under Configuration.\n  Find Tunnel Service address in Service Endpoints.\n  Click Edit.\n  Enter the root password.\n   Click Apply.\n  Accept the certificate request.\n  Go back to System Health and check that the connectivity to the Tunnel Service is okay.\n  Affected paired sites #  Such a certificate change impacts both cloud and on-premises sites that are paired to this Cloud Service. In order to restore the regular operation, you will need to re-pair all connected sites.\nOn-premises #  To re-pair with an on-premises site, your tenant needs to:\n  Open the VMware Cloud Director Availability on-premises appliance URL.\n  Log in as root.\n  Click on Settings in the left pane.   Find Pairing under Site Details.\n  Click Repair.\n   Enter all information in the wizard and accept the certificate request.\n  Finish the wizard.\n  Cloud #  To re-pair with a cloud site, the remote cloud site admin needs to:\n  Open the VMware Cloud Director Availability UI of the remote site.\n  Log in as root.\n  Click Peer Sites under Configuration in the left pane.\n  Select the cloud site with the changed certificate (marked with an error).   Click Repair.\n  Click Update and accept the certificate request.\n  A message indicates there are actions to be performed on the other site.  Once these steps are performed, you need to do the same at the local site. Other appliances #  If you plan to replace all self-signed certificates with CA-signed ones, you can follow the steps described for the Cloud Service. The only difference is in the affected services as follows:\n  When changing the SSL certificate of a Manager Service, the trust between all Replicator Service instances is invalidated. To re-establish it, you need to register all Replicator Service instances by performing Repair from their UI and re-pair the cloud sites.\n  When changing the SSL certificate of a Replicator Service, it leads to a paring problem with Manager Service. You need to re-pair to the Manager Service on the local site and re-establish the trust between all cloud sites.\n  When changing the SSL certificate of a Tunnel Service, you need to re-establish the connectivity between it and the Cloud Service. To do so, you can perform Procedure 1. For about 30 minutes, you might see a Generic error occurred during TLS handshake message, but you do not need to perform any actions to fix it. The reason is that the certificate replacement restarts the service, which breaks the sessions with the remote cloud or on-premises replicator. The session initiation happens every 30 minutes, which means that all remote sites should auto-recover pairing in no longer than 30 min.\n  When changing the VMware Cloud Director SSL certificate, you need to re-establish the trust connection from the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service UI.\n  When changing the Lookup Service SSL certificate, all VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances need to trust the Lookup Service certificate once again.\n  Backup and restore #  One of the features in VMware Cloud Director Availability, which enables backing-up all appliances, is very useful when planning to perform changes to any of the services.\nConsidering that replacing the certificates impacts the operation of VMware Cloud Director Availability, we always recommend generating a backup before proceeding with any of the steps for updating the SSL certificates. You can see how in this blog post.\n"},{"id":54,"href":"/docs/dr-migration/design/","title":"DR and Migration Design","section":"DR and Migration","content":"DR and Migration Design #  The {VVS for CP Title} validated solution has objectives to deliver prescriptive content about the solution so that it is fast to deploy and is suitable for use in production environments.\n   Objective Description     Main objective Provide {VVS for CP function} for VMware Cloud Foundation infrastructure components. {optionally add: through services in the VVS}   VMware Cloud Foundation architecture support vSAN ReadyNodesConsolidatedStandardSingle VMware Cloud Foundation instanceMultiple VMware Cloud Foundation instances with NSX FederationSingle or multiple VMware Cloud Foundation instances with multiple availability zonesVxRail NodesStandardSingle VMware Cloud Foundation instanceMultiple VMware Cloud Foundation instances with NSX FederationSingle or multiple VMware Cloud Foundation instances with multiple availability zones   Workload domain type support Management Workload domainVI Workload domain   Scope of guidance Detailed design for solution components.Deployment and initial configuration of intelligent logging and analytics components for management and VI workload domains.Operational guidance for solution components, such as operational verification, password management, and certificate management.Solution interoperability with solution components, such as monitoring and life cycle.

Certificate signing Certificates are signed by a certificate authority (CA) that consists of a root and intermediate certificate authority layers.    Architecture #  The following diagram shows the network flow between the VMware Cloud Director Availability components and the other infrastructure components part of the replication process.\nOther Components #  Platform Services Controller #  All the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances need to be configured with a Lookup Service for two purposes:\n Service authentication and resource discovery – the Replicator and Management appliances require registration with a Lookup Service to authenticate to the resource vCenters and discover resources which is required for operations from the VMware Cloud Director Availability workflow. Authentication to the VMware Cloud Director Availability service by the administrator which is not mandatory. The Lookup Service has to be the one used by vCenters providing compute resources to VMware Cloud Director. For cases when the management and resource vCenters use different Lookup Services and the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances are deployed at the management vCenter, they need to be configured with the Lookup Service of the resource vCenter(s) from/to which they will protect VMs/vApps.  The Lookup Service and the associated Single Sign-On (SSO) domain is the boundary of a single VMware Cloud Director Availability instance. This is because a single Cloud Replication Management appliance can be registered with a single Lookup Service providing DR and migration services only for workloads in this SSO domain. For cases when the cloud provider has multiple PVDCs in more than one SSO domain, a VMware Cloud Director Availability instance (tunnel, manager, replicators) needs to be deployed per each SSO domain. It is possible to deploy a dedicated VMware Cloud Director Availability instance per PVDC, but one can protect as many PVDCs as exist in a single SSO domain.\nvCenter Server #  VMware Cloud Director Availability needs to discover the workload VMs that need to be protected or migrated and destination resources (clusters, datastores, networks, etc.) for incoming replications and/or migrations in vCenters that are configured to provide the resources for VMware Cloud Director.\nThe Replicator is the component that communicates with the vCenter Servers. The tunnel has no such requirement.\nVMware Cloud Director #  The integration with VMware Cloud Director is done through the Cloud Replication Management appliance. The Cloud service communicates with VMware Cloud Director to discover the vApps/VMs for outgoing replications/migrations or destination resources (OrgVDC, network, storage) for incoming replications/migrations. VMware Cloud Director Availability uses the VMware Cloud Director API to request the information and initiate any operations.\nAs part of the initial setup, the administrator provides the VMware Cloud Director API HTTPS Base URL followed by /api and user account, which is a member of the System organization with its password. Then VMware Cloud Director Availability inspects the certificate presented by VMware Cloud Director. If the FQDN of the API HTTPS Base URL is not set as the Subject Alternative Name DNS entry, the registration cannot be completed. It is not enough to have this FQDN present in the certificate Common Name field. When a TLS connection to VMware Cloud Director is established and the authentication with the provided credentials is successful, VMware Cloud Director Availability uses the VMware Cloud Director REST API to discover its UI endpoint. Depending on its value, the VMware Cloud Director Availability HTTP server is dynamically reconfigured - the respective domain is added to the CORS allowlist.\nAdditional Information: CORS is an HTTP mechanism that provides better security to end-users. Depending on how the server is configured, browsers may reject attempts to load resources from a server that is on domain A, but someone tries to load it in domain B. The VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud service is set to allow only one VMware Cloud Director endpoint - the VMware Cloud Director UI endpoint or, if it is not configured, the API endpoint. Once the certificate and credentials check are successful, VMware Cloud Director Availability deploys the files required for extension operation in the VMware Cloud Director cells.\nESXi hosts #  The Replicators communicate with hosts to:\n Configure the source VM for replication by enabling IO filter and configure it where to send replication data Allocate resources in the host for the destination replication  These operations are performed by the HBRsrv service. For authentication purposes, it needs to communicate to the hosts on port 80/tcp. For the data traffic, it uses 902/tcp to hosts to send the replication data (for incoming replications) and 44046/tcp from the hosts to receive replication data (for outgoing replications).\nData Paths #  Two appliances are responsible for the replication data path – the Replicator and the Tunnel. The Cloud Replication Management appliance does not handle any replication data.\nCloud Tunnel #  The Tunnel is a transparent proxy that is aware of the TLS protocol. It receives the incoming traffic and redirects it to the backend components based on its type. The management and HTTPS/API traffic is sent to the Cloud Replication Management, and the replication data traffic is sent to Replicator. It does not perform any operations on the replication traffic. The Tunnel appliance does not consume significant compute resources, but in environments with many replications may handle a significant amount of network traffic. As it is published to the Internet via DNAT, it is recommended to connect it to a DMZ network where all the necessary security measures for such publish rules are taken.\nCloud Replicator #  The Replicator appliance runs three services – HBRsrv, LWDproxy, and Replicator.\nThe HBRsrv is a low-level component that communicates with the replication IO filter in ESXi hosts. The protocol used for communication is called LWD (Light Weight Delta) - a VMware proprietary protocol. This service is not aware of vCenter and does not communicate with it. The HBRsrv service is responsible for saving the VM deltas generated during the RPO window on the destination datastore. It is a common service for other VMware replication products, and VMware Cloud Director Availability reuses it for moving replication data at the last mile. It configures the ESXi filter to send the replication traffic between the ESXi host and source Replicator in \u0026ldquo;plain text\u0026rdquo;. When the data is received by the source LWDproxy, it gets encrypted and optionally compressed. On the destination site, there\u0026rsquo;s another LWDproxy that decrypts and decompresses the LWD traffic, and the destination Replicator sends the replication data to an ESXi host.\nThe LWDproxy is a VMware Cloud Director Availability service that ensures that replication traffic is sent to the Tunnel and is encrypted and compressed outside the local infrastructure. The LWDProxy service communicates with the Tunnel for sending/receiving replication data. Encryption and compression result in increased CPU utilization for the Replicator appliance. This may reduce the number of replications a single Replicator can handle.\nThe Replicator service is a VMware Cloud Director Availability management service that sends configuration instructions to the HBRsrv and LWDproxy services for every replication handled by the Replicator appliance. It understands the vCenter objects like hosts, VMs, datastores, etc. In this way, the Replicator discovers and prepares the source VMs for replication and creates objects (independent disks) for the incoming replications. It is supposed there will be hundreds or thousands of VM replications/migrations in a cloud environment. Even if the number of replications is lower than the maximum supported handled by a single Replicator, it is highly recommended to deploy at least two or more replicators. With several Replicators, the load generated by the replications can be spread over multiple hosts. Balance the replication traffic on more physical uplinks and distribute the load better. A single Replicator can be put in maintenance mode during a maintenance window without affecting replication traffic.\n"},{"id":55,"href":"/docs/dr-migration/detailed-design/","title":"DR and Migration Detailed Design","section":"DR and Migration","content":"DR and Migration Detailed Design #  The {VVS for CP Title} validated solution uses {VVS Product} deployed on top of а VMware Cloud Foundation VI workload domain to \u0026hellip;\nLogical Design for {VVS for CP Title} #  The logical design consists of multiple elements that enable you to deploy and manage infrastructure used to {VVS Product Purpose}.

The number of hosts in resource vCenters/clusters is significantly higher than the number in the management cluster. A recommendation is to deploy Replicators on resource hosts and not in the management cluster so more Replicators can be deployed and a DRS rule can be created to keep the Replicator VMs on different hosts for better load distribution. Also, the replication traffic path from the Replicator appliances to the replication network on the resource hosts will be enhanced. The hosts can use the management vmkernel interface to communicate with the Replicator. Another option is to have a dedicated vmkernel interface for replication purposes only. Using the management vmkernel simplifies the configuration but significantly reduces the control options available to the administrator and can lead to a risk for routing uncompressed replication traffic, which is highly non-desired. The general recommendation is to use a dedicated vmkernel for the replication traffic. In this case, the administrator will have better control over the infrastructure. Using NIOC, the administrator will be able to set shares for different types of vmkernel traffic. It enables carrying the replication traffic over dedicated uplinks.\nNote: If any other VMware HBR-based replication products (vSphere Replication, VMware Site Recovery Manager or VMware HCX) are used in this cloud, configuring a dedicated vmkernel interface marked with “vSphere Replication” and “vSphere NFC Replication” will lead to all of these products try to use it. This means the network connectivity between their appliances and the replication vmkernel interfaces will be required to enable all of these products to operate successfully. For more information, please consult with respective product documentation.\nStorage Requirements #  For a successful test failover, the destination storage must accommodate double the source virtual machine disk size. VMware Cloud Director Availability 4.2 and later do not consume double the disk size during failover.\n Example required space in the datastore, for a source virtual machine with a 2 TB virtual disk. When the replication is created, VMware Cloud Director Availability allocates 2 TB in the destination storage. VMware Cloud Director Availability allocates additional 2 TB when starting a test failover task. After finishing the test failover task, the additional 2 TB space is unallocated. Example for a VMware vSAN storage, with the same virtual machine. The same storage implication applies, where the vSAN must accommodate double the virtual machine disk size. When the replication is created in this example, VMware Cloud Director Availability allocates 2 TB multiplied by the vSAN_Protection_Level_Disk_Space_Penalty. When starting a test failover task, additional 2 TB are allocated multiplied by the vSAN_Protection_Level_Disk_Space_Penalty.

The software-defined platform delivers applications consistently across bare metal servers, virtual machines and containers to ensure a fast, scalable, and secure application experience.\nLBaaS Anatomy #  The NSX Advanced Load Balancer Platform (Avi) is architected on software-defined principles, decoupling the data and control planes. As a result, it centrally manages and dynamically provisions pools of application services, including load balancing, across multi cloud environments.\nArchitecturally, the Platform comprises three core elements:\n The Avi Controller - provides central control and management of the Avi Service Engines. It orchestrates policy-driven application services, monitors real-time application performance (leveraging data provided by the Avi Service Engines), and provides for predictive auto-scaling of load balancing and other application services. Furthermore, it is capable of delivering per-tenant or per-application load balancing — increasingly in demand in multi cloud contexts — and also facilitates troubleshooting with traffic analytics. The Avi Service Engines (SEs) - distributed software that runs on bare metal servers, virtual machines, and containers. They implement application services across on-premises datacenters, colocation datacenters, and public clouds. They also collect data relating to application performance, security, and clients. As distributed software, Avi Service Engines are capable of horizontal auto-scaling within minutes while functioning as service proxies for micro services. The Avi Console - provides web-based administration and monitoring. It is a web server running on the controller and offers a UI for configuration of application services, delivers visualization of network configurations and virtual IPs (VIPs), and displays application health scores and transaction round-trip times. It’s also where customers can view performance, security, and client insights, as well as where they can view service interactions.  VMware Cloud Director Support #  Starting with version 10.2, VMware Cloud Director provides load-balancing services by using the capabilities of VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi). VMware Cloud Director supports L4 and L7 load balancing that you can configure on an NSX-T Data Center edge gateway.\nAs a system administrator, you deploy the NSX Advanced Load Balancer controller cluster with the other management solutions in the management infrastructure.\nThe NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller uses APIs to interface with NSX Manager and vCenter Server to discover the infrastructure. It also manages the lifecycle and network configuration of Service Engines (SE). The Avi Controller cluster uploads the SE OVA image to the vCenter Server content library and uses vCenter APIs to deploy the SE VMs.\nThis integration happens through an NSX-T Cloud configured in NSX ALB before being imported into VMware Cloud Director.\nLoad balancing services are associated with NSX-T edge gateways, which can be scoped to an organization VDC or a data center Group.\n​The system administrator has the flexibility to decide whether a service engine group is dedicated to a single edge gateway or shared between several edge gateways.\nTenant users have full self-service UI and API load balancing capabilities in VMware Cloud Director.\nA service engine node is a VM with up to 10 network interfaces (NICs). The first NIC is always used for the management and control traffic. The other nine are used to connect to the NSX-T edge gateway (tier-1 gateway) using a service network logical segment. The service networks are created by VMware Cloud Director when you enable the load balancing service on an edge gateway with the DHCP service to provide IP addresses for the attached SEs.\nBy default, the IP address used is 10.255.255.0/25 subnet. The system administrator can change the IP address if it coincides with the existing organization\u0026rsquo;s VDC networks.\nService Engines run each service interface in a different VRF. As a result, IP conflicts or cross-tenant communication does not occur. Avi automatically picks a service engine to instantiate the load balancing service when the tenant configures a load balancing pool and virtual service.\nWhen an SE is assigned, Avi configures a static route (/32) on the organization VDC edge gateway pointing the virtual service VIP (virtual IP) to the service engine IP address from the tenant\u0026rsquo;s load balancing service network.\nProvider and Tenant Responsibilities #  As a system administrator, you deploy an Avi Controller Cluster, complete the initial configuration and the association with NSX-T and VMware Cloud Director. Once the integration is ready, you deploy and enable load balancing on an NSX-T edge gateway and assign it a service engine group.\nAn organization administrator creates load balancer server pools and virtual services.\nDeployment \u0026amp; Configuration #  Requirements #  Please find the full list of requirements in the planning and preparation page.\nDeploying the Avi Controller Cluster #  To ensure complete system redundancy, the Avi Controller must be highly available. Three Avi Controller VMs will form a highly available control plane for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer.   Download the Controller OVA from my.vmware.com portal. Follow this KB article to download the Controller OVA image. Log into the vCenter server through a vSphere Client and deploy a first Avi Controller: Follow the Deploy OVA Template wizard instructions:  Choose a port group for Destination Network in Network Mapping. This port group is the management network for the Controller and will be used for all management communication (e.g., Avi Controller communication with vCenter). Specify the management IP address and default gateway (only static IP addresses should be used in a production environment). The \u0026lsquo;Sysadmin login authentication\u0026rsquo; key is used to specify an SSH public key and is NOT required.   Repeat the last steps to create two additional Avi Controllers to be used to form a three-node Controller cluster which will form the control plane for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer. Create an anti-affinity \u0026lsquo;VM/Host\u0026rsquo; rule to make sure Controller VMs are placed on separate hosts. Power on Controller VMs.  Just like any other infrastructure management system, CPU and memory should be 100% reserved on Avi controllers.  Avi Controller Cluster Initial Setup #  This section shows the steps to perform initial configuration of the Avi Controller using its deployment wizard. You can change or customize settings following initial deployment using the Avi Controller’s web interface.\nConfigure NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller cluster to provide a highly available control plane for the NSX Advanced Load Balancer.\n Initialize the first NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller VM  In a web browser, navigate to the first controller IP or FQDN. Note: While the system is booting up, a 503 status code or a page with following message will appear: \u0026ldquo;Controller is not yet ready. Please try again after a couple of minutes\u0026rdquo;. Wait for about 5 to 10 minutes and refresh the page.   Once the NSX Advanced Load Balancer welcome screen appears, create an admin account. Complete the remaining steps by configuring all required parameters (DNS, NTP, SMTP, etc.). Select No Orchestrator in the Orchestrator Integration page. Leave the Tenant Settings configured by default.   Configure an NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller cluster  Navigate to Administration \u0026gt; Controller and select Edit. Specify the Name and the Controller Cluster IP. Add the details for each of the three NSX Advanced Load Balancer Controller nodes.  Click on Save. It will take a few minutes for the services to restart and the Controller cluster to be up. In a web browser, log in to the Controller cluster VIP. Navigate to Administration \u0026gt; Controller and ensure all the Controllers show State as Active which represents a healthy Controller cluster. Setup licensing in Administration \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Licensing. Basic or Enterprise licenses are set at the controller cluster level. You cannot mix both licenses in a single Avi Controller cluster instance.   Finish the Controller Cluster configuration (alerting, backup, etc.). Note: the full configuration of the Avi Controllers general settings is outside the scope of this document.    VMware Cloud Director integration with NSX Advanced Load Balancer fails if the default self-signed certificate is used.\nBy default, the Controller cluster Portal will be setup with a self-signed certificate which does not have a valid SAN (Subject Alternative Name) and makes the integration with VMware Cloud Director impossible. VMware Cloud Director will reject any URL that does not match the values present in the certificate, which is to conform with industry standard security guidelines and our platform criteria.\n Setup of Avi Controller cluster Portal certificate is outside the scope of this document.\nAdditional resources:\n Deploying an Avi Controller Cluster Avi SSL/TLS Certificates  NSX-T Cloud #  The point of integration in Avi, with any infrastructure, is named a cloud. For NSX-T environment, an NSX-T cloud has to be configured.\nAn NSX-T cloud is defined by an NSX-T manager and a transport zone. If an NSX-T manager has multiple transport zones, each will map to a new NSX-T cloud. To manage load balancing for multiple NSX-T environments each NSX-T manager will map to a new NSX-T cloud.\nNSX-T cloud general considerations:\n An NSX-T cloud has a one-to-one relationship with a network pool backed by an NSX-T transport zone. DHCP checkbox: the Service Engines are expected to get an IP via DHCP on the management subnet  To create an NSX-T cloud, log in in to the Avi Controller and:\n Navigate to Infrastructure \u0026gt; Clouds. Click on Create and select NSX-T Cloud.  Following the general parameters, the NSX-T section allows to configure the future service engines network configuration:\n The transport zone must match the overlay transport zone configured in the network pool in VMware Cloud Director. The NSX-T cloud requires two types of network configurations:  Management Network: the tier-1 logical router and overlay segment to be used for management connectivity of the service engine VMs has to be selected. The first vNic of each service engines will be connected to that management network (which must be created upfront, with DHCP enabled). Data Network: although not required for the VMware Cloud Director integration, it is required to set a dummy data network to avoid having the NSX-T cloud object in a degraded state.    VMware Cloud Director will automatically complete the data network tier-1 logical routers and segments when load balancing is enabled on tier-1 acting as NSX-T edge gateways.   Each NSX-T cloud can have one or more vCenters associated to it. vCenter objects must be configured on Avi for all the vCenter compute managers added to the NSX-T that has ESXi hosts that belong to the transport zone configured in the NSX-T cloud.  Additional resources:\n Multiple vCenters with NSX-T Cloud  Service Engine Groups #  A service engine group is an isolation domain that also defines service engine node sizing (CPU, memory, storage), bandwidth restrictions, availability modes, and network access.\nResources in a service engine group can be used for different virtual services, depending on your tenant\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nTo create a service engine group, log in in to the Avi Controller and:\n Navigate to Infrastructure \u0026gt; Cloud Resources \u0026gt; Service Engine Group. Using the \u0026ldquo;Select Cloud\u0026rdquo; drop down menu, select the relevant NSX-T cloud. Click on Create.  The basic settings page allows to configure the high availability mode, the service engine capacity and limit settings, as well as other advanced parameters. The official Avi documentation can help to size appropriately the service engines in terms of CPU, memory and disk.\nService engines VMs may be automatically deployed on any host and storage that most closely matches the resources and reachability criteria for placement.\nStarting in Avi 20.1.3 and onwards, it is possible to tailor the service engine placement in terms of:\n vSphere folder vSphere hosts and cluster vSphere datastore  You may create multiple service engine groups depending on your tenants requirements for high availability, placement or performances.  Additional resources:\n Sizing Service Engines  VMware Cloud Director Service Admin Portal #  After the NSX Advanced Load Balancer deployment and configuration with the NSX-T infrastructure, the next step is to register the controller cluster with VMware Cloud Director.\nTo provide virtual service management capabilities to your tenants:\n Register your Avi Controller instances with your VMware Cloud Director instance. Register your NSX-T Cloud instances with VMware Cloud Director. Import all the relevant service engine groups to your VMware Cloud Director deployment.  Consumption #  Enabling Load Balancing #  Before an organization administrator can configure load balancing services, a system administrator must enable the load balancer on the NSX-T edge gateway and assign at least one service engine group to it.\n Navigate to the NSX-T edge gateway on which you want to enable load balancing. Under Load Balancer, click General Settings. Click Edit and enable the Load Balancer function for this particular edge. (optional) Enter a network CIDR for a service network subnet.  The service network is an internal construct; as such, it is not exposed to the tenant. Only change the default specification (192.168.255.1/25) if it overlaps with an existing organization VDC network.  Once load balancing is enabled, the next step is to manage the service engine group assignment on the edge gateway.\n Under Load Balancer, click Service Engine Groups. Select an available service engine group from the list. For shared service engine groups, the system administrator must set the maximum and reserved number of virtual services that can be placed on the edge gateway (within the capacity of the service engine group)  Design considerations:\n A system administrator can assign one or more service engine groups to an NSX-T Data Center edge gateway. All service engine groups that are assigned to a single edge gateway use the same service network.  Load Balancer Server Pool #  After a system administrator assigns a service engine group to an edge gateway, an organization administrator can create and configure virtual services that run in a specific service engine group.\nThe heart of a load balancer is its ability to effectively distribute traffic across healthy servers. A server pool is a group of one or more servers that you configure to run the same application and to provide high availability.\nIf persistence is enabled, only the first connection from a client is load balanced. While the persistence remains in effect, subsequent connections or requests from a client are directed to the same server.\n Under Load Balancer, click Pools, and then click Add. Configure the general settings for the load balancer pool.  Add members to the server pool.  Note: pool health status and pool member health status will remain Down until a virtual service is created and service engines are deployed.  Additional resources:\n Add a Load Balancer Server Pool  Virtual Service #  A virtual service listens for traffic to an IP address, processes client requests, and directs valid requests to a member of the load balancer server pool.\nA virtual service is a combination of an IP address and a port that uses a single network protocol. The virtual service is advertised to outside networks and is listening for client requests. When a client connects to the virtual service, the load balancer directs the request to a member of the configured load balancer server pool.\nTo secure SSL termination for a virtual service, you can use a certificate from the certificate library. For more information, see Import Certificates to the Certificates Library.\n Under Load Balancer, click Virtual Services, and then click Add. Configure the general settings for the load balancer pool. Enter a meaningful name and, optionally, a description, for the virtual service. To activate the virtual service upon creation, toggle on the Enabled option. Select a service engine group for the virtual service. Select a load balancer pool for the virtual service. Enter an IP address for the virtual service. Select the virtual service type.  The Virtual IP (VIP) can be any arbitrary IPv4 address. The VIP can be a routable external IP address allocated to the organization VDC edge gateway or any internal routed address:\n An external organization VDC edge gateway allocated IP address; no DNAT is required, but you cannot use this IP for NAT anymore due do the internal packet processing. An arbitrary internal IP (DNAT required). In that situation, the VIP must not coincide with any existing organization VDC networks or with the load balancer service network.  A static route will be automatically created on the Tier-1 from the VIP to the relevant service engine node IP.\n Additional resources:\n Create a Virtual Service  Health Monitoring #  VMware Cloud Director manages the health of the following load balancing components:\n NSX-T Cloud Virtual services Server pools  VMware Cloud Director provides basic monitoring and metrics about the virtual services and pools to both providers and tenant administrators.\nProviders can see the basic usage metrics for each service engine groups deployments (number of applications, usage, and running SE engines).\nTenants can see some basic metrics about each virtual service (up or down and traffic). Analytics is only available if the controller are imported with Enterprise License.\nAdvanced Features Consumption #  Although some advanced features are not exposed in VMware Cloud Director, they can be provided as a managed service. This includes (but is not limited to) Web Application Firewall (WAF) or custom Health Monitors.\nAvi Intelligent Web Application Firewall #  Web application firewalls (WAFs) are intended to protect businesses from web app attacks and proactively prevent threats. Traditional web application security solutions do not provide visibility and security insights that administrators can use to create an effective application security posture. Enterprises need real-time visibility into application traffic, user experience, security and threat landscape, and application performance to identify and protect against the most sophisticated attacks.\nAvi leverages software-defined architecture and its strategic location on the network to gain real-time application insights. The built-in WAF solution provides application security and networking teams with an elastic and analytics-driven solution that scales and simplifies policy customization and administration through central management.\nAvi intelligent WAF (iWAF) plays an integral role in a defense-in-depth strategy that does comprehensive threat analysis, mitigates risk, provides zero-day protection against unpublished exploits and optimizes application security.\nAs of today, Avi iWAF capabilities are not exposed in VMware Cloud Director for self-service configuration and consumption. However, a system administrator can assign WAF policies to existing virtual services.\nAdditional resources:\n Avi Intelligent Web Application Firewall  Custom Health Monitor #  Avi validates if the backend servers are functioning efficiently by sending active health monitors on a periodic basis. Avi Vantage also tests if they can accommodate additional workloads before load balancing a client to a server. Health monitors originate from the service engines assigned to the application\u0026rsquo;s virtual service. The health monitors are attached to the pool for the virtual service.\nA pool may have multiple actively concurrent health monitors (such as Ping, TCP, and HTTP), as well as a passive monitor. All active health monitors must be successful for the server to be marked up.\nWhen configuring a server pool from the tenant portal, a tenant administrator can choose between 5 health monitors: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP and PING. However, a system administrator can create and customize advanced health monitors from the Avi UI, and assign them to existing server pool.\nOnce the additional health monitor is associated with the server pool, it will appear in the tenant portal: a tenant administrator can remove it but not add it in self-service.\nResources #   NSX Advanced Load Balancer Integration with NSX-T NSX-T Support in NSX Advanced Load Balancer  "},{"id":68,"href":"/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/","title":"Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director Design","section":"Networking and Security","content":"(this page is here as a placeholder)\nClouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.\nAvi controller deployed and managed by provider SEs are outside of tenant domains Service Engine Groups can be dedicated or shared. It is a provider decision on how to manage this.\nDedicated: If a tenant wants to pay to have dedicated LB compute (for throughput reasons) Shared: Normal model for providers to leverage multiple edges and potentially multiple tenants on the same compute resources\nNote: the shared VS dedicated is more about how the provider wants to manage how the tenants uses which SEGs As we must follow Basic licensing, Service Engine Groups configuration need to be configured in Legacy HA (Active/Standby) Mode This impact the number of Virtual Services per Service Engine Group\nDesign considerations\n NSX Advanced Load Balancer supports load balancing only in an NSX-T Data Center transport zone of type overlay.  The network adapter 1 of the Service Engine VM is reserved for management connectivity. You can connect only one of the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2-10) of the Service Engine VM to the VIP or data segment. The other interfaces must be left disconnected. The service engines are deployed in one arm mode. The same interface is used for the client and backend server traffic. The SE routes to backend servers through the Tier 1 router. The SEs on a dedicated logical segment: • Allow to manage the IP address assignment separately for SE interfaces. • In the current version, this segment must be created on NSX-T Data Center before adding it to the cloud configuration on NSX Advanced Load Balancer. Only logical segments connected to the tier-1 router are supported. The cloud automation for NSX-T Data Center integration does not support placing SEs on logical segments directly connected to tier-0 routers.\nThe Controller cluster VMs can be deployed adjacent to the NSX Manager for NSX-T Data Center, connected to the management port group: • Dedicated tier-1 gateway and logical segment for the SE management. • Management IP address of the SEs must be reachable from controller. • Tier-0 must advertise the learned routes to the external router using BGP.\nVCD will prevent you to use more that one Avi NSX-T Cloud per VCD Geneve network pool.

There is one NSX Manager for each vCenter server instance utilizing NSX.\nAll virtual machines deployed to an NSX prepared host are candidates for NSX usage. The administrator needs to consider partitioning tenant VMs onto networks depending on their NSX usage. To avoid NSX metering for Virtual Machines that are not utilizing NSX, consider deploying the VMs to a vCenter cluster that is not prepared for NSX. The figure below shows two different vCenter clusters within the same vCenter domain. Virtual machines that are not utilizing NSX should be deployed to the cluster that is not prepared for NSX.\nFeature Detection #  The fact that a virtual machine can potentially access a service through the network will result in the VM being metered for the service. A VM will be considered as using NSX for metering purposes if:\n The virtual machine is connected to a network (backed by any type of switch) with access to an NSX edge. The virtual machine is connected to an NSX logical switch or distributed switch on an NSX prepared host. The virtual machine is referenced by a non-default distributed firewall rule, including groups/policies.  Note: The default DFW rule is the ‘Allow’ action.\n The virtual machine is connected to a network (backed by any type of switch) with access to a distributed logical router. If a virtual machine is connected to an Edge service through the network, the VM will be metered for the service.  Usage Meter examines the switches, routers, and gateways managed by the NSX Manager, and creates a graph of connected networks. It then determines the VMs that are connected to each switch. VMs are metered for NSX usage based on their ability to reach a gateway or router through the network. Usage Meter does not examine individual Virtual Machines, network traffic, or routing tables to determine actual usage.\nUsage Meter examines the list of NSX features available to a Virtual Machine and selects the minimum license needed to enable the features. Each VM is metered based on the NSX edition and the VMs vRAM configuration. The following table lists the NSX components examined by Usage Meter to determine available NSX-V features.\nNote: NSXFint is a column that appears in the Virtual Machine History report for VMs that are using NSX. NSXFint has an integer value and represents the NSX features used by a metered VM. The NSXFint value per NSX-v feature is shown in the table below. The NSXFInt value for each metered VM will be the integer value of the NSX feature or the integer sum of all NSX features used by that VM.\nFor example, a VM using the NSX Edge load balancing and Distributed firewalling features will have the following value in the NSXFInt column = 2+64=66.\nNote: Each NSX-v feature has a unique NSXFint value. However, the following NSX-v features are all reported as integer 1 and are essentially undistinguished: Distributed switching and routing, NSX Edge Firewall, NAT, Integration with vRealize, and OpenStack, VPN (IPSEC and SSL). These features are Base features, and if a VM uses a couple of them, then Usage Meter will only meter them as a single Base feature used by that VM. As a result, the sum of these NSX-v features will have an NSXFint value equal to 1.\nFor example, if a VM uses Distributed switching and routing and NSX Edge Firewall, this VM will only have a value of NSXFint=1.\nTo find the features used by a VM, subtract from the NSXFint value the highest possible value equal to or less than the NSXFint value, and continue the subtraction until NSXFint =0.\nFor example, let’s have a VM that has NSXFint = 9.\n We will check in the table below which NSX feature has a value equal to or less than 9 and subtract it from NSXFint. In this case, the highest number close to NSXFint =9 is 8, corresponding to Dynamic Routing with ECMP (Active-Active). The result of the subtraction is NSXFint - 8= 9-8=1. We will check again in the table what NSX feature has a value equal to 1. This feature is a Base feature and could be any of the following features: Distributed switching and routing, NAT, VPN (IPSEC \u0026amp; SSL), NSX Edge Firewall, Integration with vRealize and OpenStack. When we also subtract it from NSXFint, the NSXFint value will equal 0. In conclusion, NSXFint =9 is NSXFint=8+1, corresponding to ECMP dynamic routing and a Base feature.

NSX-V Scenario Samples #  Scenario One: Minimum NSX configurations\nA virtual machine VM1 is deployed to a vSphere host on an NSX enabled cluster. The virtual machine is not connected to a switch. The VM is automatically connected to the NSX Distributed Firewall.\nMetering By default, the VM is connected to a distributed Firewall. VM1 will not be metered for NSX usage unless the default distributed firewall rules have been modified to reference the VM. If the DFW is in use using non-default rules, then the VM will be metered for NSX Advanced Edition.\nA virtual machine VM1 is deployed to a host on an NSX enabled cluster. The VM is connected to a switch. The VM is automatically connected to the NSX Distributed Firewall. The administrator has not modified the default DFW rules.\nMetering VM1 will be billed for NSX (Base Edition) since it is connected to a distributed switch.\nScenario Two: Base Edition Example\nTwo virtual machines VM1 and VM2 are connected to different VXLAN backed networks with routing through a Distributed Logical Router. Both virtual machines have access to a remote network through an Edge Gateway ESG, running a Firewall service. Neither of the VMs are referenced by non-default DFW rules.\nMetering VM1 and VM2 are both metered for NSX Base edition since both distributed switching and routing, and edge firewall are base edition features. **Scenario Three:**Active / Active Gateway\nDynamic routing with ECMP (Active-active) Edge\nMetering VM1, VM2, and VM3 are billed as NSX Base since ECMP is a Base feature, and all VMs have potential access to the edge. This scenario illustrates the feature selection based on the most advanced feature reachable by a Virtual Machine through the network.\nScenario Four: NSX Partitioned by Tenant\nTwo different Tenants A and B, each with their own network and ESG. No shared Switch, DLR or ESG.\nMetering VM1 is metered for NSX usage based on the services running on the ESG1 accessible to VM1. VM2 is metered for NSX usage based on the services running on the ESG2 accessible to VM2.\n Scenario Five: ESG on vSphere Distributed Switch (Not a logical Switch)\nVM1 on an NSX prepared Cluster and attached to vSphere Distributed Switch, not a Logical Switch. ESG running a load balancer service attached to the same vSphere Distributed Switch. VMs are using only default DFW rules.\nMetering VM1 is metered for NSX (Base Edition) since Edge Load balancing is a Base feature and is accessible to the VM through the distributed switch.\nScenario Six: NSX Cross vCenter shared ESG\nAn NSX Edge Gateway, ESG shared between vCenter Domains using a Universal Logical Switch. Both virtual machines are using only default DFW rules.\nMetering VM1 and VM2 are both billed as NSX Enterprise since the ESG connects to a Universal Logical Switch, and all VMs have access to the ESG.\nNSX Reporting #  NSX usage can be included in reports as a license edition line item or as a standalone line item. Usage reporting is based on editions unless standalone reporting is requested. NSX-V Q\u0026amp;A\nQ1: What are the minimum configurations that Usage Meter will detect as NSX usage?\n A VM connected to a Logical Switch will be detected as an NSX BASE edition. This is the case even when no distributed logical routers or NSX edges are created. A VM with a vNIC referenced in a distributed firewall rule (non-default) will cause the VM to be detected as NSX Advance, even if the VM is not connected to a logical switch, distributed logical router, or edge.  Q2: Are the Virtual Machines that implement NSX functionality (for example, NSX Controller VMs and Edge Gateways) billed for NSX usage?\n Yes, NSX management VMs are billed for NSX Base usage. The only VM excluded from metering is the Usage Meter appliance.  Q3: An NSX Edge Gateway can be installed on a vCenter cluster that is not prepared for NSX. In this case, is the NSX Edge and the Virtual Machines utilizing the edge billed for NSX usage?\n Installation of an edge gateway on unprepared servers is supported only when the Edge is running the L2VPN Client. It is assumed that the client hosting the gateway will not be metered by Usage Meter.  Q4: Does Usage Meter infer the content of a distributed firewall rule? For example, if two rules cancel out one another.\n No, Usage Meter does not examine the relationships between firewall rules. Usage Meter will meter the VM for DFW usage if any of the DFW rules in a policy reference the vNIC either directly or through a security group (static or dynamic).  Q5: If a VM is connected to multiple networks, what rate is metered at?\n The VM is metered at the rate of the network with the highest level of service features.  Q6: If a VM is listed in the NSX Firewall exclusion list, does Usage Meter bill for Firewall usage?\n No, Usage Meter does not bill DFW usage for VMs in the NSX firewall exclusion list.  Q7: On an Edge configured as a Remote Gateway (also known as L2VPN), what VM’s are metered for NSX Usage?\n L2VPN can be configured as \u0026ldquo;Server\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Client\u0026rdquo;. In both cases, all VM\u0026rsquo;s with access to the Edge are metered by Usage Meter.  Q8: How does Usage Meter detect if NSX Cross vCenter is configured?\n Usage Meter detects the Universal logical switch configured on a local edge.  Q9: Does Usage Meter detect and bill for NSX vShield Endpoint (guest introspection to support anti-malware) solutions?\n Yes, Usage Meter detects vShield Endpoint as a base NSX feature.  Q10: An NSX Edge can be deployed to an ESX Server that is not prepared for NSX. Can the edge be connected to a logical switch?\n No, it is not possible to create a Logical Switch on a server that is not prepared for NSX.  Q11: Are Virtual Machines connected to a vNetwork Standard Switch (vSwitch) or vNetwork Distributed Switch (dvSwitch) metered for NSX Usage?\n Yes, all switch types that are serviced by an NSX Edge are metered. Logical switches will be metered even if there is no NSX Edge servicing it.  NSX-T Features #  Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 inspects the topology of the virtual NSX network, obtaining lists of all known:\n Virtual machines Virtual Network Interfaces Logical ports Logical switches (aka \u0026ldquo;segments\u0026rdquo;) Logical routers (aka \u0026ldquo;gateways\u0026rdquo;)  Usage Meter reports usage for each VM, based on the feature and license editions described in the table below. Note: NSXFint is a column that appears in the Virtual Machine History report and represents the sum of the integer code of the NSX features used by a VM. Each NSX- T feature has a unique NSXFint value. In the table below, you can find the NSXFInt value for each NSX-T feature metered by Usage Meter. The value of the NSXFInt column in the Virtual Machine History report for each metered VM will be the sum of all NSX-T features used by that VM. For example, a VM using the Layer 2 VPN (aka \u0026ldquo;Remote Gateway\u0026rdquo;) and 3rd party service insertion features will have the following value in the NSXFInt column = 128+1024=1152. To find the features used by a VM, subtract from the NSXFint value, the highest possible value equal to or less than the NSXFint value, and continue the subtraction until NSXFint =0. For example, let’s have a VM that has NSXFint value = 3.\n We will check in the table below which NSX feature has a value equal to or less than 3 and subtract it from NSXFint. In this case, the highest number close to NSXFint =3 is 2, corresponding to Edge load balancing. The result of the subtraction is NSXFint - 2= 3-2=1. We will check again in the table what NSX feature has a value equal to 1. This feature is Distributed switching and routing. When we also subtract it from NSXFint, the NSXFint value will equal 0. In conclusion, NSXFint =3 is NSXFint=2+1, corresponding to Edge load balancing and Distributed switching and routing.

Latency requirements are critical to guarantee proper functioning and performance:\n Latency among Avi controllers – Less than 10 ms Latency between any Avi SE to any Avi Controller – Less than 75 ms recommended Latency between Avi Controller and NSX-T Manager – Less than 10 ms recommended  Best practice is to co-locate in the same port group/management infrastructure as NSX-T   Latency between Avi Controller and VMware Cloud Director – Best practice is to have have VCD cells in the same management infrastructure as NSX-T manager and Avi Controller  The Avi Controller and service engines use several ports for management and control communication: Protocol Ports Used by Avi Vantage for Management Communication.\nThe firewall should allow traffic for these ports.\nPreparation #  The solution comprises of the Avi Controller which uses APIs to interface with the NSX-T manager and vCenter to discover the infrastructure. It also manages the lifecycle and network configuration of the service engines.\nThe NSX-T Cloud is the object that permits the integration with the NSX-T manager and the vCenter server(s).\nThe user accounts configured on the Avi Controller require the following roles and permissions for the integration to work successfully:\n Roles and Permissions for vCenter user Roles and Permissions for NSX-T user  vSphere #  When using an NSX-T Cloud, the Avi Controller uploads the service engine image to the content library on the vCenter server and uses this to create new virtual machine every time a new service engine is required. The content library must be created on vCenter before configuring the NSX-T cloud.\nNSX-T #  The first network adapter of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity, and the remaining 9 data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.\nThe Avi SE management interface can be connected to an overlay (recommend) or a VLAN logical segment. When connected to an overlay segment, it also needs a tier-1 gateway to provide external connectivity to be able to reach the Avi controller management IP. It is recommended to have a dedicated tier-1 gateway and segment for Avi service engine management.\nIf VLAN-backed logical segments are used instead of overlay transport zone for the management network in the NSX-T Cloud, refer to this page: NSX-T VLAN Logical Segment.  Regardless of the solution (overlay or VLAN segment for the SE management network), the NSX-T topology must be created upfront the NSX-T Cloud configuration.

It is designed to guide you through the essential steps to configure all the appliances at the same time, no matter if it is a combined or a distributed environment (only the distributed setup is recommended for production).\nFor example, you can define the Lookup service, attach a Cloud Replicator Appliance or a Cloud Tunnel Appliance, and even change the root password for of all appliances, without any necessity to log in to each of them and change it in their UI.\nA detailed look at the initial setup wizard #  YouTube video showing the exact steps\nAfter you successfully deploy the OVA templates for all the appliances, the next step is to run the initial setup wizard.\nFirst, you need to login to the appliance by opening your browser and entering the following URL: https://\u0026lt;Cloud-Replication-Management-Appliance-URL\u0026gt;/ui/admin.\nYou will see the login screen of the VMware Cloud Director Availability Cloud Service admin UI. There, you have to enter the password defined during the deployment process.\nSince it is the first login to the system, you will be prompted to change the password.\nAfter you enter a new password that matches the password policy (it should be at least 8 symbols and contain at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character), you will see the welcome screen (Picture 3).\nAfter reading and complying with the information on the welcome screen, proceed with the configuration of the Cloud Director Availability, by clicking Run Initial Setup Wizard. Note that all the steps are mandatory, and you cannot skip any of them.\nThe first thing to do is to enter your license key.\nNext, you need to give your site a name and provide the Service Endpoint address. In case you are not sure about the address at the moment of setup, you can leave it empty and fill it later in the VMware Cloud Director Availability portal (Configuration menu).\nOn the next screen, you have to fill in your VMware Cloud Director Endpoint address and an administrator’s credentials. Note that you only need to type the Endpoint URL, and the wizard will automatically add the https:// prefix and /api suffix.\nBy clicking Next, you are prompted to reject or accept the VMware Cloud Director certificate. To proceed further, you need to accept it.\nAfter accepting the certificate, you will be asked for your consent to participate in the VMware\u0026rsquo;s Customer Experience Improvement Program (\u0026ldquo;CEIP\u0026rdquo;). By default, it is checked, but you can uncheck it and proceed with the wizard.\nThe penultimate step is to connect your Cloud Replicator Appliance(s) (if you have more than one). An important note - on this step, you enter the Lookup Service Address. It is used for all your replicators and the tunnel.\nAfter entering all the Lookup Service Address, Replicator Service Address, and root password, you need to click TEST CONNECTION to verify the connectivity and connect to the Cloud Replicator Appliance. Similarly, to the VMware Cloud Director Service Endpoint, you only need to put the IP/URL, and the port, prefix, and suffix are added automatically. You need to perform the same set of actions for all the Cloud Replicator Appliances you want to attach.\nRight after clicking the TEST CONNECTION button, you will be prompted to reject or accept the Cloud Replicator Appliance certificate. To proceed, accept the certificate.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t logged in the Cloud Replicator Appliance UI so far, you will see a message that the root password has expired. You can directly set a new root password from the wizard. The password policy is the same as for the Cloud Replication Management Appliance. If you change the password before running the wizard, you will proceed directly to the last step without being asked to change the root password.\nYou also need to provide the SSO administrator credentials.\nThe ADD A REPLICATOR SERVICE INSTANCE button will let you connect additional Replicator Services if wanted.\nIf all the details are entered correctly, you will be prompted to reject or accept the Lookup Service certificate. To proceed, accept the certificate.\nThe very last step of the setup process is to connect to the Cloud Tunnel Appliance. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to define the Lookup Service Address again as the wizard uses the one set on the previous step. You only need to enter the API URL and the root password. Note that the prefix and port are added automatically.\nSimilarly, to the previous step where we connected to the Cloud Replicator Appliance(s), if you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed the root password yet, you could do it after clicking the CHECK PASSWORD button. Note that if you have already changed the password, the UI will direct you to the next action.\nBy clicking Next, you will be prompted to reject or accept the Cloud Tunnel Appliance certificate. To go through, you need to accept it.\nThe last stage of the wizard is a summary that will show you some of the details you entered. Use the Finish button to close the initial setup wizard and start using your newly configured VMware Cloud Director Availability.\nOn the picture below, you can see how the home screen looks like after performing a successful configuration.\n"},{"id":87,"href":"/docs/dr-migration/vcda-vmc-on-aws-sddc/","title":"Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability at a VMC on AWS SDDC","section":"DR and Migration","content":"Setting Up VMware Cloud Director Availability at a VMC on AWS SDDC #  Prerequisites #  To be able to successfully deploy and run VMware Cloud Director Availability in your VMC on AWS environment, you will need to make sure the following requirements are met:\n Have a properly deployed Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC).

It allows service providers to offer reliable, automated protection for workloads hosted on their own cloud infrastructure and being replicated to another cloud destination (DR of the cloud) or workloads running on customer premises and being replicated to the cloud infrastructure (DR to the Cloud). Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 supports the metering of SRM Protected VMs. A protected VM is any virtual machine that is part of an SRM protection group, regardless of whether the VM is powered-on or off. A license is only required for the VM on the active site; no license is required at the failover site. The SRM collector is part of the vCenter collector on the Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 appliance. All collected SRM protected VM details will be in the vCenter collection archives. The collector collects data once a day, and it tracks only the protected VMs present in the protection group.\nNote: vCloud Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 only supports metering of protected VMs in READY state and not protected VMs in SHADOWING state.\nProduct Detection #  SRM is automatically detected in vCenter when the latter is added for metering in the Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 web application. The appliance checks if there is an SRM instance installed on the metered vCenter, and if there is, it receives information from the SRM server for the count of the protected VMs. The service providers do not need to provide site details for the SRM metering. They can deactivate the SRM metering from the UM 4.5.0.1 web application for any added vCenter. Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 detects and meters SRM versions from 8.2.1 to 8.5.\nMetering of SRM provides enhanced billing bi-directional support, for example, from protection to failover site and from failover to protection site. Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 supports the metering of multiple failover sites, for example, from site A to site B and from site A to site C. If any site part of a pair of sites is not added to a Usage Meter appliance, then no VM will be counted as a protected VM.

The Usage Meter administrator can switch between the vRAM metric and CPU cores metric any time during the metering period. The default metering metric is vRAM. Any of the following Tanzu editions can be selected in the Usage Meter web application as well.\n Tanzu Basic Tanzu Standard Tanzu Advanced  Note: Currently, Usage Insight will only report Tanzu-related usage as Basic in the monthly usage reports, irrespective of the selected Tanzu edition. In future vCloud Usage Insight releases, there will be a fine-grain mapping of the Tanzu-related usage and its correlating edition.\nNote: It is recommended that a single Usage Meter instance meters a single Tanzu edition. For datacenters using different Tanzu editions, there should be a separate Usage Meter installation for each used Tanzu edition. Metering\nOnly Tanzu Basic-related VMs are metered based on Tanzu Basic usage. The following type of VMs will be considered as Tanzu Basic-related VMs:\n Supervisor VM: These VMs are Kubernetes control plane VMs. Three Kubernetes control plane VMs in total are created on the hosts that are part of the Supervisor Cluster. The three-control plane VMs are load-balanced as each one of them has its own IP address. Additionally, a floating IP address is assigned to one of the VMs. vSphere DRS determines the exact placement of the control plane VMs on the ESXi hosts and migrates them when needed. vSphere DRS is also integrated with the Kubernetes Scheduler on the control plane VMs so that DRS determines the placement of vSphere Pods. When as a DevOps engineer, you schedule a vSphere Pod, the request goes through the regular Kubernetes workflow, then to DRS, which makes the final placement decision. POD VM: A vSphere Pod is a VM with a small footprint that runs one or more Linux containers. Each vSphere Pod is sized precisely for the workload that it accommodates and has explicit resource reservations for that workload. It allocates the exact amount of storage, memory, and CPU resources required for the workload to run. vSphere Pods are only supported with Supervisor Clusters configured with NSX-T Data Center as the networking stack. TKG VM: VMs running and managing Tanzu Kubernetes clusters. A Tanzu Kubernetes cluster is a full distribution of the open-source Kubernetes container orchestration platform that is built, signed, and supported by VMware. You can provision and operate Tanzu Kubernetes clusters on the Supervisor Cluster by using the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service. Both main nodes and worker nodes are metered in the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster.  Tanzu Basic supports both time-based average vRAM metering metric and CPU cores metering metric.\n vRAM metric (Time-based average vRAM usage): Average vRAM usage for all Tanzu Basic-related powered-on VMs. CPU cores metric (Time-based average of host CPU core count): Average host cores usage for all hosts with at least one powered-on Tanzu Basic-related VM. A host is metered for the period where there was at least one powered-on Tanzu Basic-related VM running on this host during the metering period. All cores of the host are metered for the duration.  For example, if there is at least one powered-on VM that is running on a host with 6 CPU cores for any of the 10 days in a 30-day period, this host will be billed with an average host CPU core count of 2, (6 * (1/3) = 2). If a host -whether it has been modified or added or placed into migration mode (i.e., host state changes) - has been running even a single VM, the host is metered for the duration where there is at least one powered-on Tanzu Basic-related VM.\nReporting #  Tanzu Basic Usage (if detected) is always reported as a standalone line item in the Monthly Usage Report.\nSample Monthly Usage Report #     Product Hostname Version VC UUID Units of Measure Units to be Reported     Tanzu Basic    Avg Capped Billed vRAM (GB) 20   Tanzu Basic    Avg Number of Cores 6    Note: The report above shows both the vRAM and CPU cores usage are detected by Usage Meter. This could mean that the Usage Meter administrator has registered a single Tanzu Basic enabled vCenter and switched between the vRAM metric and CPU core metric during the metering period. Multiple vCenters with different metering metrics registered to the Usage Meter cloud also produce two-line items in the report. If the same metric is selected during the entire metering period for all vCenters registered in the Usage Meter, only one-line item with the selected metric will be shown in the report.\nVirtual Machine History Report: #  The column \u0026ldquo;vmType\u0026rdquo; is included in the Virtual Machine History report indicating the types of VMs in the report:\n   vmType Translation     SUP Supervisor VM   POD POD VM   TKG VMs created by vSphere Tanzu Kubernetes Grid service   OTHERS VMs that are not categorized as SUP, POD or TKG    Note: Tanzu will not be shown in \u0026ldquo;associated products\u0026rdquo; on the vCenter registration and management page even if detected by Usage Meter.\n"},{"id":102,"href":"/docs/cloud-infrastructure/vcenter-metering/","title":"vCenter Metering and Reporting","section":"Cloud Infrastructure","content":"vCenter Server Metering and Reporting #  Usage Meter collects product usage information from all vCenter servers that are registered with Usage Meter.\nNote: Usage Meter does not traverse Enhanced Linked Mode, and it requires registering all vCenter servers, part of this mode, to meter their usage data.\nNote: VMware Cloud Provider Program partners should utilize VCPP licenses for all servers used in the service delivery path or administration control plane.

Despite its administrative rights, the CloudOwner user misses some privileges (like Host.Config.Connection, for example) for the VMware Cloud Director Availability Classic data engine to operate properly. Even the temporary elevation of the CloudOwner privileges (link) does not help to perform a successful replication.\nHowever, out-of-the-box Google Cloud VMware Engine creates 5 vSphere solution users with full administrative privileges. They are intended to be used by products like VMware Cloud Director, VMware SRM and also other VMware and non-VMware tools. By using one of the solution users during the VMware Cloud Director Availability configuration, the product can successfully create and maintain a healthy replication. A description of the solution user accounts and steps how to enable them is available here.\nNOTE: The password of the solution user expires 365 days after it was changed last. This means resetting it needs to be considered every year not to disrupt the service.\nGoogle Cloud VMware Engine Network Configuration #  In terms of internal networking and communication, Google Cloud VMware Engine is not as restrictive as VMC on AWS, for example. There is no need to define firewall rules for enabling the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances to access the ESXi hosts, for example.\nStill these requirements need to be met:\n Have a network segment for the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances to connect to.

This leads to the need to use multiple network interfaces to support that scenario and guarantee the product will continue operating as per design.\nThere are a few main reasons that lead to this design:\n  Bypass a router\n  Port forwarding is not possible\n  Inability to route the replication traffic\n  Separation of the incoming replications to different isolated networks\n  Design #  You need to take two considerations before the implementation of VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances that will have multiple NICs:\n  Which interface will be used for the communication with the rest of the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances?\n  How will the routing be organized - to which interface the default gateway will be configured and what static routes will be required?\n  The General recommendation (GR01) is to deploy the appliances with the interfaces that will be used for communicating with each other. When following this recommendation, the VMware Cloud Director Availability services will discover and set to use the first NIC (ens160) and its first IP address. The only additional change that might be required is to move the default gateway to a different NIC and configure one or more static routes on ens160.\nMoving the Default Gateway #  To perform the necessary steps, you have to connect to the appliance. The recommended way is to use DCUI because the configuration changes might lead to losing network connectivity.\n First, you need to unconfigure ens160. Example command:  /opt/vmware/h4/bin/net.py unconfigure-nic ens160\nThen configure only the IP address of ens160 without setting a default gateway on it. Example command:   /opt/vmware/h4/bin/net.py configure-nic --static -a 192.168.10.10/24 ens160\nConfigure the static route(s) for ens160. Example command:   /opt/vmware/h4/bin/net.py add-route ens160 destination_subnet gateway metric\nNote: You can use this command multiple times for setting more than one static route.\n(Optional) Configure the name servers. Example command:   /opt/vmware/h4/bin/net.py configure-dns --servers ns01_ip ns02_ip --search-domain domain1 domain2 \nOnce you finish the configuration and the appliance is accessible over the network, you can connect through SSH or use the UI.\nReconfigure the VMware Cloud Director Availability Appliances #  For cases where GR01 is not followed, some actions need to be taken so the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances can use the IP address set to an interface different from ens160.\nCloud Tunnel #  It is essential to know that only one of the Cloud Tunnel interfaces can be used for communication with the rest of the VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances in the local site. For pairing purposes all the interfaces of the tunnel appliance can be used.\nTo reconfigure the Cloud Tunnel, you need to:\n  Set IP addresses to all interfaces and configure the static routes.\n  Log in as root through SSH to the Tunnel appliance.\n  Authenticate as root to the Tunnel service via CLI. Example command:\n   h4 -k tunloginroot 'r00t_Password'\nCheck the current service configuration.

The value of this parameter will be used to configure the other local VMware Cloud Director Availability appliances – Cloud Replication Manager and Cloud Replicator(s) - when they are prepared to communicate with the tunnel. This parameter can be set to a specific IP address or null. Setting it to null will lead to the service discovering the first IP address in the system and use it. In this example, the ens160 IP address is 192.168.1.2, and the ens192 IP address is 172.18.24.4.\nNext, we need to configure the Tunnel service to use the IP address of ens192.

In the Configured section it is set to null which means the service will try to discover an interface with a successfully configured IP address and bind itself to this address.\nIn this example, the ens160 IP address is 192.168.2.81, and the service currently uses this interface. The IP address of the ens192 interface is 172.17.31.81.\nWe will configure mgmtAddress to use ens192 with IP address 172.17.31.81.

The content below describes the manual deployment process required to setup the Google Cloud projects, configure them, deploy a Software Defined Data Center (SDDC), associate it to CDs, and the process to configure a virtual private network (VPN) solution for connectivity to isolated networks.\nA virtual private network (VPN) provides traffic tunneling through an encrypted connection, preventing it from being seen or modified in transit. VMware NSX® Data Center for vSphere includes a remote access VPN feature (IPsec) that allows the connection from a remote site to connect securely to the private networks and applications in the organization virtual data center.\nDue to a limitation in VPN technology in Google Cloud, the provider will need to select an alternative solution such as an open source or commercially available, depending on the required features and available support. Examples of open source solutions include OpenVPN or StrongSwan. This deployment guide will walk through the steps required to implement the StrongSwan solution to provide the VPN connectivity between the provider-managed customer project and the T1 edge that sits in front of the tenant networks. The VPN solution is deployed and configured manually in addition to being managed separately from CDs.\nDisclamer\nVMware does not endorse, recommend, or support any third-party utility or solution.\nA general knowledge of networking and security, as well as on VMware Cloud Director concepts is also required.\nConfigure Provider Project and Create Required Resources #  The following section describes the steps required to setup the cloud provider project.

If a vCenter server monitored by vROps is added to Usage Meter, then this vCenter will appear as a referenced vCenter in the details of the added vROps instance.\nvCenter servers monitored by a vRealize Operations server, which are also added for metering by Usage Meter, are named “Managed vCenter” servers. vCenter servers monitored by a vRealize Operations server but not added for metering to Usage Meter are named “Unmanaged Servers”.

For the billing of monitored VMs will be taken the vRealize Operations instance with the highest edition.\nUsage Meter connects to a vRealize Operations server using the account provided by the Usage Meter administrator. Usage Meter will meter all VMs that are visible through the provided account.\nTo meter only a subset of monitored VMs, for example, to divide monitoring by Tenant, vRealize Operations should be configured to filter the monitored virtual machines to include only a subset of the VMs deployed to the monitored vCenter instance.\nThis is accomplished by creating a new account in vRealize Operations and configuring Role Base Access Controls to restrict the view of the account to the desired Virtual Machines. The RBAC restricted account and credentials are provided to Usage Meter when the vRealize Operations server registration is completed.\nRefer to the Product Usage Guidefor detailed configuration instructions.\n) Figure 10\nMetering #  The vRealize Operations license edition is retrieved by Usage Meter from the vRealize Operations server during each data collection. vRealize Operations metering is based on Virtual Machines monitored by a vRealize Operations Server. Service providers are responsible for reporting usage for monitored VMs and OSI Instances (which represent non-virtualized servers). Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 does not track OSI instances monitored by vRealize Operations or add-on packages such as Blue Medora. Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 automatically detects the following vRealize Operations editions:\n vRealize Operations Standard vRealize Operations Advanced vRealize Operations Enterprise  When Usage Meter connects to a vRealize Operations instance, it checks for its version. If the version of the metered vRealize Operations instance is 8.6 or later, Usage Meter checks if there are VMs part of a license group. If there are such VMs, Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 reports them against the highest vRealize Operations edition assigned to that license group. In case there is a VM part of multiple license groups, then Usage Meter will report the highest edition of the first license group it queries.\nFor vRealize Operations instances with previous versions, Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 will only report the monitored VMs against the highest vRealize Operations edition that it detects. Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 will not check if there are VMs part of license groups for vRealize Operations before version 8.6.\nFor example, if Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 connects to vRealize Operations 8.5 and it detects two license editions: Advanced and Standard, then for all VMs monitored by that vROps, the reported license by Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 will be Advanced. In the Monthly Usage Report, the highest detected vROps license edition by Usage Meter will be reported irrespective of the vROps version. The highest license against which a VM is reported can be checked in the Virtual Machine History Report.\nReporting #  vRealize Operations is reported by Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 as either Flex Add-on or standalone. When usage is reported as a Flex Add-on, the metric is the Avg Capped Billed vRAM value of the monitored Virtual Machine. When reported standalone, the metric is the Average Number of Virtual Machines monitored by vRealize Operations during the reporting month.\nThe following rules apply to the reporting of vRealize Operations:\n vRealize Operations Standard, Advanced and Enterprise editions are reported as a Flex add-on or standalone depending on the customer’s preference. vCenter servers using vRealize Operations will always be reported as a standalone line item on the monthly usage report as (unmanaged) if they are not added to vCloud Usage Meter. When vRealize Operations edition is reported as standalone, and the vCenter servers monitored by it are added to Usage Meter 4.5.0.1, then the monthly usage report will include a single line vRealize Operations edition (managed). Unmanaged vCenter Servers are associated with only one vRealize Operations instances if monitored by multiple vRealize Operations instances. The VMs of those unmanaged vCenter Servers will be billed once based on the vRealize Operations instance with the highest edition.  Metering Scenarios #  Scenario One: vRealize Operations Server monitoring both SP and Tenant vCenters\nFigure 11\nConsider the following reporting scenario: A vCenter server is registered with Usage Meter.\nA vRealize Operations server that monitors the same vCenter is also added for metering to Usage Meter 4.5.0.1. Usage Meter queries the vRealize Operations server to determine what vCenter servers it monitors. The vRealize Operations server returns a list of three vCenter servers, only one of which is registered with Usage Meter. Usage Meter monthly report will include 2 Unmanaged vRealize Operations servers and 1 Managed vRealize Operations server line items.\n"},{"id":113,"href":"/docs/cloud-infrastructure/vsan-metering/","title":"vSAN Metering and Reporing","section":"Cloud Infrastructure","content":"vSAN Metering and Reporting #  vSAN is activated at a host-cluster level either while creating new clusters or updating existing host clusters. vSAN aggregates all local storage devices across all hosts in the vSAN cluster into a single datastore. More storage devices or hosts can be added to the cluster to expand its datastore capacity. If a host contributes to the vSAN datastore, it must provide at least one device for flash cache and another for persistent storage. Capacity devices are also called data disks. The devices on the contributing hosts form one or more disk groups, and each disk group contains one flash cache device and one or more capacity devices. Devices used for caching cannot be shared across disk groups. Each host can be configured to use multiple disk groups. The amount of physical capacity from the vSAN datastore consumed by one or more VMs at any point is called the consumed capacity.\nConfiguration #  With Usage Meter 4.5.0.1, vSAN is automatically detected. There should be at least one vSAN cluster per vCenter Server so that Usage Meter detects and meters it. When one or more clusters in the vCenter are enabled with vSAN, the vCenter product configuration list page in the Usage Meter web application indicates that vSAN is associated and used for that vCenter.\nFeature Detection #  vSAN usage is metered per vSAN enabled cluster (see Cluster History Report) and reported aggregated by vSAN license editions (see Monthly Usage Report). vSAN usage is collected on an hourly basis by the Usage Meter appliance. vSAN usage collection intervals are closed when one or more of the following scenarios occur:\n vSAN collection fails to send collected data for 24 hours or more vSAN enabled cluster is deleted vSAN license has changed When vCenter product is not metered and/or deleted from the Usage Meter web app Products page.  Note: The collection intervals are shown in the vSAN Cluster History Report.Specific space efficiency and QoS features are detected during these hourly collections and are used to determine the billing rate of vSAN usage.\nvSAN usage is metered at a cluster level. While there are many features and capabilities that vSAN offers, from the perspective of usage metering, Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 records the following cluster-level and VM-level features:\n Cluster level: Base , Deduplication, Compression, Stretched Cluster, Data-at-rest Encryption, File Services, HCI Mesh, Shared Witness, Data in Transit Encryption, and Cloud Native Storage. When these features are enabled, the entire cluster is marked as using these features. At a VM level, usage is reported per cluster: Raid 5/6 Erasure Coding feature is enabled at the individual virtual machine level but scoped and reported at the cluster level. If one or more virtual machines (regardless of the power state) have enabled this feature, then this feature is considered enabled for the entire cluster. Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 examines the vSAN features enabled for the cluster to determine the reported license edition. The following vSAN features are automatically detected by Usage Meter and reported in the vSAN Cluster History Report.     vSAN Features vSAN Standard vSAN Advanced vSAN Enterprise     Stretched Cluster   X   Raid 5/6 Erasure Coding  X X   File Services   X   Deduplication and Compression  X X   Data-at-rest Encryption   X   Base X X X   HCI Mesh   X   Shared Witness X X X   Data in Transit Encryption   X   Cloud Native Storage X X X    Note: Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 detects VMs compliant with Storage Policy - Raid 5/6 Erasure Coding. When one or more VMs in a vSAN enabled cluster are compliant with this policy, customers are billed at vSAN Advanced edition.\nvSAN Reporting #  vSAN usage is reported as monthly aggregated total used storage capacity by a vSAN license edition in the Monthly Usage Report generated by Usage Insight. More granular information about the vSAN usage can be seen in the vSAN Cluster History Report (see an example below). This report includes information about what storage capacity and features have been used by a cluster per time interval. It also shows the detected vSAN license edition of a cluster. The features that are used by a vSAN cluster can be calculated from the vSANFint column in that report. See the vSAN Cluster History Report information. The average used storage for vSAN is calculated as: Average GB = (Sum of consumed storage capacity in GB per-hourly collections) / (Hours in a month). The value can be zero if no vSAN usage exists or vSAN was not configured. Average Used Storage means the storage capacity consumed by all virtual machine disks (VMDK) and not available for new allocations in GB averaged during the applicable reporting period. This includes swap space (if utilized) and the RAID overhead set within the storage policy.\nNote: Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 only reports usage against the vSAN license the detected features are part of. For example, a cluster with a vSAN Enterprise license is detected to use features also part of vSAN Advanced, like Compression and Deduplication. In this case, if there are no other features used that are only part of vSAN Enterprise during the reporting month, then the Monthly Usage Report will report usage against the vSAN Advanced edition. The following vSAN editions are reported in the generated reports by Usage Insight:\n vSAN Standard. vSAN Advanced. vSAN Enterprise  Note: vSAN is not reported standalone and included in Horizon DaaS bundles. Also, vSAN with Desktop and ROBO licenses are excluded from the usage reports.\nvSAN Cluster History Report #  vSAN Cluster History Report contains the used capacity (in MB) per time interval for vSAN enabled clusters in vCenter Servers metered by Usage Meter 4.5.0.1. Additionally, it displays the vSAN license edition and the features used by a cluster. Note: To verify which vSAN cluster features were detected by Usage Meter 4.5.0.1, use the integer value in the table below and compare it with the vsanFInt column in the Cluster History Report.\nA vSAN cluster might use several features, and the way to find them is to subtract from the vSANFint value for a cluster the highest possible int value of a vSAN feature detected by Usage Meter.\nFor example, if you have a value of 6 in the vSANFint column in the cluster history report, subtract 4 (the highest possible value of a vSAN feature that can be subtracted from 6). The int value of 4 represents Compression, as seen from the table below. The result of the subtraction will be 2 (6-4), which stands for Deduplication. In conclusion, the cluster with a vSANFint value of 6 in the vSAN cluster history report uses two vSAN features: Compression and Deduplication.\n   Feature Feature Int Value     BASE 1   DEDUPLICATION 2   COMPRESSION 4   ERASURE_CODING 8   STRETCHED_CLUSTER 16   DATA_AT_REST_ENCRYPTION 32   FILE_SERVICES 64   DATA_IN_TRANSIT_ENCRYPTION 128   CLOUD_NATIVE_STORAGE 256   HCI_MESH 512   SHARED_WITNESS 1024    Sample Cluster History Report and Monthly Usage Report\n   VCHostName vSAN ClusterId vSAN ClusterName vSAN License vSAN Used (MB**)** From To Interval vSANFint     0UfypLEAUZCz domain-xyz 0UfypLEAUZCy std 2500 2021-12-18 11:32:14 2021-12-18 17:05:31 05:33:17 1   0UfypLEAUZCz domain-xyz 0UfypLEAUZCy std 3500 2021-12-19 11:32:14 2021-12-19 19:05:31 08:33:17 1   0UfypLEAUZCz domain-abc 0bxyzABCkMy ent 9500 2021-12-18 17:05:31 2021-12-19 18:05:31 1 day 00:59:59 6   0UfypLEAUZCz domain-abc 0bxyzABCkMy ent 2500 2021-12-20 11:05:31 2020-12-20 18:45:50 07:40:19 6    In the Cluster History Report, the vSAN license is the edition activated for a cluster and detected by Usage Meter 4.5.0.1. Another important column in the report is vSANFint. With the values in this column, you can identify the features used by a cluster per time interval. The detected features determine the vSAN license edition by which the aggregated usage will be reported in the Monthly Usage Report. There might be a difference between the detected license edition activated for a cluster and the reported license edition in the Monthly Usage Report. This happens when the cluster has used only a portion of the features part of the license. These features are also part of another license, e.g., a cluster with an Enterprise license has only used features that are also part of the vSAN Standard edition. As a result, only what has been used during the reporting period is reported against the respective license edition in the Monthly Usage Report. See below what the Monthly Usage Report will be for the vSAN consumption shown in the above Cluster History Report:\n   Product Hostname Version VC UUID Unit of Measure Units to be Reported     VMware Virtual SAN Standard    Avg Billed vSAN Storage (GB) 2   VMware Virtual SAN Advanced    Avg Billed vSAN Storage (GB) 5    The units reported in the Monthly Usage Report for vSAN are calculated based on the average vSAN storage capacity consumption throughout the month in GB per vSAN license edition, rounded down to the nearest whole number.\nNote: The vSAN storage consumption in the Cluster History Report is shown in MB; thus, it must be converted to GB to check if the usage in the Cluster History Report matches that in the Monthly Usage Report.\n"},{"id":114,"href":"/docs/developer-ready-cloud/implementation/","title":"Developer Ready Cloud Implementation","section":"Developer Ready Cloud","content":"Developer Ready Cloud Implementation #  Implementing {VVS for CP Title} validated solution includes configuring \u0026hellip; and enabling \u0026hellip;\nTo implement and configure {VVS for CP services}, two alternative methods exist.

This allows a user to generate API tokens for programmatic access to VCD. It works for both, provider, and tenant users. An automation script or 3rd-party solution can then use the API token to make API requests to Cloud Director on behalf of the user.\nThese steps are used to create API tokens:\n The provider propagates the right to use and manage API token to the tenant The Cloud Director user (provider as well as tenant user) creates an API token An API client (e.g. an automation script) uses the API token to make requests (If needed) The user revokes the API token  Preparation #  As for most new features, fine-grained access control through rights bundles is possible. To enable a tenant to use API token, the provider must publish a rights bundle to the tenant. Privileges can be defined for a user to manage the user’s own tokens, and to manage all Organization user’s token (for example for an Organization Administrator).\nCreate the API Token #  As provider or tenant user with proper privileges you can use the “User Preferences” menu to create the API token. Each token can be labeled with a name. Be aware that the actual token key is only visible once in the creation wizard and cannot be retrieved afterwards.\nRevoke the API Token #  API tokens do not expire, but existing API tokens can be revoked. This also invalidates active API client sessions that used the token to authenticate. All users can revoke their own tokens. Administrators (those with \u0026lsquo;manage all user\u0026rsquo;s API tokens\u0026rsquo; right) can revoke other user\u0026rsquo;s tokens. Tenant administrators can do so within their own Organization, while system administrators can do so for any user.\nUse the API Token #  Semantically the API token usage follows the OAuth 2.0 specification (RFC 6749, section 6).\nThe API token can then be used by a 3rd-party solution or custom API client to access the VCD API as the user, without the need to authenticate with username and password credentials.\nAPI Client Example #  Request the bearer token for subsequent calls using the API token:\nPOST https://host_name/oauth/provider/token Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Body: grant\\_type=refresh\\_token\u0026amp;refresh\\_token=Generated\\_API_Token  Security note: It’s recommended to send the API Token as part of the request body (and not as part of the URL, even if that technically works for x-www-form-urlencoded type requests), to avoid it being logged in transit.\nResponse containing the Bearer token:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json Body: { \u0026quot;access\\_token\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Generated\\_Access_Token\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;token_type\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Bearer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;expires_in\u0026quot;:86400, \u0026quot;refresh_token\u0026quot;:null }  Subsequent API call now can use the returned Bearer token in the \u0026ldquo;access_token\u0026rdquo; field as usual. There is no need for any changes in the client code.\nSubsequent Call using the Bearer token:\nGET https://host_name/api/org Accept: application/*+xml;version=36.1 Authorization: Bearer Generated\\_Access\\_Token  Notes #  The session expiration can be configured in the provider portal under General \u0026gt; Timeouts.\nThe VCD Provider for Terraform for example supports API Token authentication as of version 3.5:\nprovider \u0026quot;vcd\u0026quot; { user = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot; password = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot; auth\\_type = \u0026quot;api\\_token\u0026quot; api_token = Generated API token sysorg = \u0026quot;System\u0026quot; ...  For security reasons, certain tasks are not possible when authenticated through an API token:\n Change the user password Perform user management tasks Create more tokens View or revoke other tokens  When accessing VMware Cloud Director by using an API access token, applications have only view rights for the following resources.\n User Group Roles Global roles Rights bundles  The API Token feature in VMware Cloud Director offers a secure way for automation solutions to access its API, even in environments that enforce Multi-factor Authentication for user logins.\nReferences #   VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal Documentation VMware Cloud Director Provider Portal Documentation OAuth 2.0 Specification (RFC 6749) VCD Provider for Terraform Documentation  "},{"id":116,"href":"/docs/cloud-infrastructure/cplcm-deployment/","title":"Cplcm Deployment","section":"Cloud Infrastructure","content":"Implementation of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager #  Implementation of VMware Cloud provider Lifecycle Manager(cplcm) includes deployment of the necessary components like VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager Appliance, NFS share for storing product binaries in VMware Cloud Foundation for automated deployment of products like VMware Cloud Director, Usage Meter, vRealize Operations Tenant App and RabbitQ\nFor information on the VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager design, refer to the Detailed design of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager section.\nPrerequisites #  Verify that your environment is configured according to Before You Apply This Guidance and the Planning and Preparation of VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager for VMware Cloud Foundation section.\nProcedure\n Deploy VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager\n Manage Cloud Provider certificate\n"},{"id":117,"href":"/docs/cloud-infrastructure/vc-dc-register/","title":"VC Dc Register","section":"Cloud Infrastructure","content":"Register Datacenter vCenter Server #  To enable VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager to manage products, first, you must register a datacenter component.\nThe datacenter components are instances or services available in the datacenter that VMware Cloud Provider Lifecycle Manager does not manage.
