From VMware Cloud Director 10.2 and onwards, VMware Cloud Director provides load balancing services in NSX-T backed organization virtual data centers (VDCs) by leveraging the capabilities of VMware NSX Advanced Load Balancer (Avi).</description></item><item><title>Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-design/</guid><description>(this page is here as a placeholder)
Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/vcd-lbaas-planning-and-preparation/</guid><description>Planning and Preparation for Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director # Introduction # Before you start implementing the Load Balancing as a Service in VMware Cloud Director solution, you must set up an environment that has a specific compute, storage, and network configuration and that provides external services to the components of the solution.
