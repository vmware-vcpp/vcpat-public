Use the VMware Cloud Foundation Planning and Preparation Workbook to capture environment specific input values that are required during the implementation.

Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Certificate Management</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/cert-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/cert-management/</guid><description>Networking and Security Certificate Management #</description></item><item><title>Networking and Security Design</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/networking-security/design/</guid><description>Networking and Security Design # The {VVS for CP Title} validated solution has objectives to deliver prescriptive content about the solution so that it is fast to deploy and is suitable for use in production environments.
