Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>Logging for Cloud Infrastructure</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/cloud-infrastructure/solution-interop-lb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/cloud-infrastructure/solution-interop-lb/</guid><description>Logging for Cloud Infrastructure # After you implement the {VVS for CP Title} validated solution, you can load balance the components that are newly added to your VMware Cloud Foundation environment.
