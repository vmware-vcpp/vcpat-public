Clouds are containers for the environment that NSX Advanced Load Balancer is installed. During the initial setup of the Avi Networks platform, a default cloud named Default-Cloud is created. The first controller is deployed in Default-Cloud. You can add clouds containing SEs and virtual services. The network adapter 1 of the service engine VM is reserved for management connectivity and the remaining nine data interfaces (network adapter 2 to 10) for the service engine VM to the VIP or data segment.</description></item><item><title>NSX Metering and Reporting</title><link>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/cloud-infrastructure/nsx-metering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vcpat.cloudhappens.io/docs/cloud-infrastructure/nsx-metering/</guid><description>NSX Metering and Reporting # Usage Meter 4.5.0.1 can detect specific NSX features available to Virtual Machines, which determines the NSX edition billed to a VM.
